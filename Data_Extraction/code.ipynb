With telemedicine, patients can schedule appointments and consult with doctors at a convenient time without having to take time off work or arrange transportation. This can be especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or mobility issues.\\n\\nTelemedicine, or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system, providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people.\\n\\nThe benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients, it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers, telemedicine can reduce the strain on already-overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible.\\n\\nThe rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040, it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape, with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely.\\n\\nOne of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high-speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past, the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor, making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However, with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools, telemedicine consultations are just as good as in-person visits.\\n\\nTelemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine, patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead, they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas, where access to healthcare can be limited.\\n\\nAnother factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer, the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time.\\n\\nAnother substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors, telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example, a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient’s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment.\\n\\nTelemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes, telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition, telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization.\\n\\nOne of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition, telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need.\\n\\nAnother way in which telemedicine will impact people’s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely, telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors’ spending on administrative tasks, freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care.\\n\\nOne major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology, it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing, remote monitoring, and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it.\\n\\nAnother factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas; patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances, saving them time and money.\\n\\nFinally, telemedicine’s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations, the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes, reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider.\\n\\nOverall, the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors, including the increasing use of technology in healthcare, the need for improved access to healthcare, and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve, likely, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape.\\n\\nHowever, the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example, telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions, and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally, telemedicine may put some jobs at risk, such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Rise of e-health and its impact on humans by the year 2030 | Blackcoffer Insights The rise of e-health, or the use of electronic means to facilitate health care, has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. The use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. By 2030, it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare, and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e-health on humans by that year.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of e-health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. With the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies, patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas, where access to healthcare providers may be limited. It can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. By 2030, it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing access to care, e-health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies, healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information, streamlining the process of providing care. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. By 2030, it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system.\\n\\nAnother potential impact of e-health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization, healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally, the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health, potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations.\\n\\nWhile the potential benefits of e-health are significant, there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches, which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e-health to exacerbate healthcare disparities, as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e-health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e-health continues to grow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by 2030 it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. The increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e-health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. However, it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks, such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities, as the use of e-health continues to grow.</td>\n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all, what is telemedicine? It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another.\\n\\nRole of tele-med during a pandemic\\n\\nTelemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, Intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.\\n\\nAdvantages of Telemed in today’s era\\n\\nPatients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. There’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.\\n\\nRise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic\\n\\nSource: The Indian Express\\n\\nThis step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.\\n\\nOur consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (Exhibit 2).\\n\\nAround 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID-19.\\n\\nIts impact on human beings over the years\\n\\nMoreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 However, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.\\n\\nIncreasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights:\\n\\n“ Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”\\n\\nAccess to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.\\n\\nIs the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?\\n\\nThe trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.\\n\\nRole of business leaders in achieving new model\\n\\nWhen creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.\\n\\nBusinesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done.

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 | Blackcoffer Insights “More gains on quality, affordability and accessibility are on the way”\\n\\nWhat do tele-med means?\\n\\nAs the world evolves and advances, so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all, what is telemedicine? It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another.\\n\\nRole of tele-med during a pandemic\\n\\nTelemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, Intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.\\n\\nAdvantages of Telemed in today’s era\\n\\nPatients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. There’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.\\n\\nRise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic\\n\\nSource: The Indian Express\\n\\nThis step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.\\n\\nOur consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (Exhibit 2).\\n\\nAround 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID-19.\\n\\nIts impact on human beings over the years\\n\\nMoreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 However, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.\\n\\nIncreasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights:\\n\\n“ Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”\\n\\nAccess to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.\\n\\nIs the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?\\n\\nThe trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.\\n\\nRole of business leaders in achieving new model\\n\\nWhen creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.\\n\\nBusinesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now.\\n\\nSumming it up\\n\\nLowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well, the transition to a tele-driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance, it could take decades—if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Rise of Chatbots and its impact on customer support by the year 2040 | Blackcoffer Insights The human race is known to come up with inventions that decide its future. Many scholars believe that Artificial Intelligence(AI) has been the most pioneering innovation since early humans discovered fire and invented the wheel. The advancement of groundbreaking technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) have constantly been shaping the future of humankind. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg have welcomed the evolution of AI. He once stated- “With A.I.especially, I am optimistic“. While according to Elon Musk, “AI can outsmart and endanger us.”However, we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential AI is in our daily lives.\\n\\nThe applications of AI and ML have delved deeply into various domains. The least to mention are Healthcare, Transportation, Education, Media, Communication, Manufacturing, andCustomer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers’ overall experiences. As a result of AI, a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots.\\n\\nChatbots are AI-based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls, FAQs, and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7, enhancing the customer experience.\\n\\nThe use of technologies such as AI, ML, and NLP (Natural Language Processing), enables the bot to analyze and identify the user’s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries.\\n\\nPlatforms such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Discord, and Slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication.\\n\\nThere are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses- Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day, which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore, chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly, and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML-based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies.\\n\\nRoughly 40 % of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology, chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come.\\n\\nAccording to some reports, it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 26% from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021, the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million.\\n\\nIt is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market.\\n\\nIn the past few years, some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology, the tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, respectively.\\n\\nDeep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue, conducting research, generating leads, and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation.\\n\\nGiven the trends of the data, we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion-dollar mark in a few years. Hence, by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi-billion dollar market value.\\n\\nBank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced “Erica” is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments, check their balances, save money, and transfer funds with this chatbot, which uses artificial intelligence, algorithms, and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice, and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer.\\n\\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers’ right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger, so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details, boarding passes, and flight status updates. On a typical day, KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic, that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute.\\n\\nThese innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040, chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain.\\n\\nThere are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI-driven chatbots are used with customers, even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers.\\n\\nThe availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer’s data is also a key challenge.\\n\\nEven though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function, there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi-folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML-based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps “The next big thing” in the customer service domain.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Rise of e-health and its impact on humans by the year 2030 | Blackcoffer Insights Introduction\\n\\nThe phrase “e-health” refers to “Internet medicine” as well as almost everything else connected to computers and healthcare. It appears that industry leaders and marketing professionals, not academics, were the first to adopt the word. To bring the promises, principles, and excitement (and hype) surrounding e-commerce (electronic commerce) to the health arena and to give an account of the new possibilities the Internet is opening up for the area of health care, they created and used this term in line with other “e-words” such as e-commerce, e-business, e-solutions, and so on.\\n\\nE-health emerged in the modern world as a result of the demand for better patient tracking of their healthcare and operations, notably for purposes of reimbursement from organizations like insurance companies. In the past, healthcare professionals kept paper records of the patient’s history and current condition. However, the development of an electronic tracking system was pushed by rising healthcare expenses and technological advancements. The field of telemedicine, in which a telecommunications medium is utilized to deliver medical care remotely, evolved as e-health technology advanced.\\n\\nGrowth of E-health\\n\\nThe e-health industry saw tremendous expansion following the epidemic, with several new companies being created as “buddies” for e-health treatment. such as the market leaders in a positive way right now, Oura Health, Vantage Health, Mendelian, and HealthifyMe. They target those who are looking for economical healthcare facilities by offering E-health at lower prices. Accessibility from the East is another aspect of e-health care brands. Some benefits of e-health care facilities include quality, improved doctor-patient relationships, a wider audience, better communication, tracking of health, and convenience of follow-ups.\\n\\nImpact of technology on E-health\\n\\nThe recently introduced 5G services will present an ocean of chances for e-health services, according to a study by “EY.” In addition to accelerating the deployment of telemedicine, 5G may improve the interaction between health sensors, algorithms, and smart gadgets.\\n\\nIn 2021, the size of the global e-health market was estimated at USD 97,640.4 million. By 2030, it is anticipated to reach USD 338,147.7 million, expanding at a CAGR of 14.8% over the forecast period (2022-2030). As we can see, the fast-expanding e-health sector is changing how healthcare is provided. This caused a large portion of the population to switch from conventional healthcare practices to electronic health. Now, more and more nations are looking for a digital strategy. The market is expanding as a result of rising government measures to encourage e-health solutions, an increase in chronic diseases, and a growing requirement to employ e-health to manage regulatory compliance.\\n\\nRise of E-health in today’s world\\n\\nAccording to a poll of more than 11,000 consumers across 16 nations, consumers still view health and fitness as “essentials,” right up there with groceries and domestic cleaning supplies, even in the face of general insecurity and financial difficulties. 80% of poll participants indicated they intended to maintain or increase their spending on areas connected to health and fitness in the coming year, such as exercise classes or vitamins and supplements, even though two-thirds (66%) of respondents stated they feel financially stressed.\\n\\nSource: Accenture consumer public survey\\n\\nRegardless of income levels, people have redefined health and well-being as essential goods and intend to maintain or increase their spending in this area this year, according to Oliver Wright, a senior managing director at Accenture and the global leader of the company’s Consumer Goods &amp; Services industry practice. “With the global spend on health and wellness expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2025, consumer-facing companies must draw on cross-industry expertise, scientific advancements, and technological innovations while also taking consumers’ shifting priorities into account when developing new offerings.” Thus, as health requirements rise along with innovation, people are more tolerant of e-health.\\n\\nSource: Deloitte\\n\\nHealthcare customers desire both easy access to medical care and positive interactions with their doctors. However, if forced to pick one, they would go with convenience. To address this, more than half of the survey participants expressed interest in implementing solutions that would enhance the consumer experience by lowering the time and difficulty associated with obtaining care. In fact, over the next three to five years, 61% of respondents intend to spend money on patient communication technologies like telehealth and messaging capabilities with their medical staff. Other consumer-specific capabilities that businesses are wanting to invest in at this time include online appointment scheduling and virtual registration.\\n\\nFuture of E-health and its role in the Pandemic\\n\\nThe system of E-health relies on interoperable digital systems to exchange information on health operations, and in the future, information from these systems might be exchanged between other nations to enhance healthcare administration. This enables inhabitants of one country who travel elsewhere for a vacation to receive better healthcare and medicine prescriptions there. Additionally, this will help the medical tourism sector as well.\\n\\nRobotics and artificial intelligence will be used more frequently in the future. Even though it will be difficult in the future for robots to operate on people, doctors are now utilizing AI to diagnose illnesses. The goal of digital healthcare in the future is to put medical facilities close to the people. M-health technologies can track patients’ vital signs and keep an eye out for anomalies. so that consumers can consult a doctor before the issue worsens This lowers the fatality rate and medical malpractice.\\n\\nThe covid-19 pandemic has already demonstrated the value of e-health technology since most hospitals were operating at limited capacity and postponing procedures as a result. As a result, during the epidemic, E-health applications were employed to maintain communication and improve patient care. All of this technology was, however, interoperable and required fast internet connections. To reduce the distance between doctors and patients, internet penetration would rise in the future, for instance with today’s 5G technology.\\n\\nSumming it up\\n\\nLast but not least, a stronger push for digital health may increase confidence in digital healthcare and increase dependence on medical websites. The vaccination movement, which is highly vocal and gaining traction through digital channels, is an example of this. The relationship between the medical staff and the patient is ultimately what drives health and wellness, but in today’s environment, digital platforms are supporting this interaction more than ever. The future standard of treatment might very well include the routine use of digital health instruments.</td>\n",

Due to the boost in the use of social media, it is easier for businesses to market and advertise their business or the products and services offered by them. It affects both businesses and consumers in a significant manner.\\n\\nHow does marketing influence business?\\n\\nIn the words of Peter Drucker: “Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two–and only two–basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.”\\n\\nMarketing doesn’t just “impact” a business – it is the function that saves a company from closing down.\\n\\nMarketing has various benefits for business such as –\\n\\nMarketing your business can have a huge impact on new businesses by creating large barriers for them to enter a well-established market.

It is a powerful way of driving sales and returns on investment (ROI). Brands using this can have a positive impact on their businesses.\\n\\nIn no sense, influencer marketing has gained significant attraction in the past one to two years. brands use online influencers for their marketing campaigns through social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook. It includes influencers creating content by interacting with the product or services offered or with the employee of the business. Influencer marketing yields better results than conventional celebrity endorsements. They can easily interact with their followers which results in better engagement. Influencer marketing plays a significant role in consumer behavior and psychology such as recommendations. In recent times we have seen various brands like beardo, and Muscleblaze use influencers on Instagram to market their product. The influencers create content about the product and services offered which creates an online marketing campaign for the businesses.\\n\\nThe content you post can have a significant impact on the development of the business. Personalized content can result in better consumer interaction. Big businesses like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, etc. are some successful examples. If we take the example of Netflix, it automatically suggests movies and web series on the search history of the user, and the same is done by Spotify. Facebook makes use of an algorithm that determines the kind of content that should be shown on the user’s feed. Amazon makes use of users’ browsing and purchasing history while displaying products when we log in to it. Spotify Wrapped is one of the music streaming service’s most effective content marketing initiatives. Every year, around the New year, Spotify subscribers receive a wonderful compilation of all the songs they’ve listened to. The compilation is presented with graphics in vibrant colors and is divided into genres, years, musicians, and more.\\n\\nUsers then have the option to share their wrapped playlists on social media, which is a crucial component that has caused the campaign to trend on social media every year since its beginning.\\n\\nSOURCE- https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/the-wait-is-over-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-is-here/\\n\\nAutomation in marketing is making use of technology to automate marketing and advertising efforts.

Nissan gathers relevant data about its customers, including the time at which each vehicle was purchased. Six months after the automobile is acquired, they can utilize the purchase date to automatically send a reminder email to schedule the first service visit. This is an essential component of Nissan’s strategy because maintenance costs collected after the sale of the vehicle make up a significant part of Nissan’s overall earnings.\\n\\nBy understanding, consumer behavior marketers can fill in the gap of how consumers buy a product and identify the product that is needed ad the obsolete products.\\n\\nStudying consumer behavior can help marketers to present the product in a way that yields higher consumer attraction. Understanding consumer behavior is the key secret to reaching out to more customers for brand recognition, engaging with the clients, and converting those into potential buyers.\\n\\nHow marketing influences consumer decisions?\\n\\nThe primary responsibility of a marketing department is to grow the market share by acquiring and keeping new clients. The best way to do that is by monitoring, evaluating, and controlling consumer behavior. Modern marketing strategies easily handle this duty. Let’s examine the how and why in more detail.\\n\\nRegularly held marketing initiatives have a significant impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. They pick one brand over another just because they saw the first one’s advertisement more frequently. Customers tend to trust some businesses more than others simply because they have better blogs, and more visually appealing material and employ opinion leaders who help customers associate with the company favorably.\\n\\nInstead of informing consumers, modern marketing aims to convince and build strong emotional bonds with brands and products. Even if people can’t recall where or when they saw a specific advertisement, they may still experience a specific emotion when they look at a product at a store, such as happiness, comfort, or confidence. It occurs because the advertising they watched caused their brain to detect a particular emotion. The brain immediately connected the product with a certain emotion when they first viewed it. When buyers select from a variety of comparable products from various companies, this relationship will operate flawlessly.\\n\\nNike advertises in a way that makes its customers comfortable. Its tagline, “Just Do It,” speaks for itself. Allowing everybody and everyone to come up with their meaning of the term makes it straightforward but to the point and helps the business build relationships with its customers. The audience is emotionally connected to this slogan.\\n\\nWe believe that each of our social, professional, and informational settings is distinct. But in reality, we all live in a world of marketing where everything is offered for sale and purchased. It’s not good or bad; it’s simply the new commercial reality that dictates what you’ll wear tomorrow, how you’ll address your boss, and how much of your income you’ll spend on eating out. With a few notable exceptions, it is generally applicable to everyone, from a young wealthy nerd who is only 20 years old to a family in their late 30s. If you give it some more thought, you’ll realize that most of the material you encounter each day attempts to sell you something, such as a good, idea, an emotion, a political viewpoint, a way of acting, etc. Marketing strategies and tactics in all their forms and guises are what produce this entire environment.\\n\\nTake, for instance, the blogs of modern businesses. Rather than being sales tools, they appear to be thematic media. Companies work to position themselves as the go-to resource for information about a given industry by disseminating their knowledge of it to consumers. In this approach, they produce a ton of content, including viral material that shapes consumer trends and purchasing patterns. Today, public perception and reputation are even more valuable than actual goods. If it has a worthwhile message to convey and is effectively promoted, even a plain chicken egg can become viral and break Instagram records.\\n\\nSource-Instagram\\n\\nBecause it informs, equalizes, supports, engages, sells, and expands a business’s operations and offers, marketing is crucial for enterprises. It is equally important in the sense that it greatly influences the potential consumer behavior of the individual. If done correctly marketing can create a huge influence on both businesses and consumers.</td>\n",

The various conventional marketing tools are advertising, branding, direct marketing, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations. Critics acknowledge that marketing has legitimate uses in as much as it connects goods and services to consumers who desire them. However, some aspects of marketing, especially promotion and advertisements, are subject to criticism. They argue that product promotion is an attempt by the goods and service providers to influence demand. Advertising has become such an inextricable part of our lives that one cannot imagine life without it. Although we hardly ever notice, advertisements leave an indelible mark on our minds, especially on vulnerable groups like children and adolescents.\\n\\nThe commensuration of the two words raises eyebrows in marketing and society, as it is highly debatable. On the one hand, Society thrives on Companies’ marketing efforts, while another school of thought argues that marketing makes society more materialistic. Today, striking a balance between the two is the challenge marketers face. Ethical expectations are a vital part of the business environment. Society expects businesses to be honest and desires corporate executives, at all levels, to apply ethical principles- in other words, guidelines as to what is right and wrong, fair and unfair, and morally correct- when they make business decisions. For better or worse, marketing is everywhere, with the allure of new products, big promises, and hope for something new or different. As we turn on the television or scroll through social media feeds, we will find it hard to avoid someone trying to sell us something. While advertising and marketing share information and tell us what is new, it does so to persuade rather than educate, so their influence can sometimes be more harmful than positive.\\n\\nThe debate about the positives and negatives of advertising is a bit like the infamous chicken or egg question. Some people claim that marketing causes adverse effects, while others argue that it merely reflects what is already happening in the culture. For all the positive potential of marketing, the reality is that it frequently influences society in negative ways. One negative aspect of marketing is its potential to feed into unrealistic expectations, breed discontentment, and influence our thought processes in ways beyond our control. Materialism, workaholism, unhealthy lifestyle habits, alcoholism, politics, and unrealistic views negatively shape our culture and impact the most vulnerable.\\n\\nAccording to research, marketing has become increasingly hostile in the modern television era. Consumers are often disturbed by advertisements &amp; marketing, and negative campaign ads tend to fuel a vicious cycle where both sides fling ads back and forth in a futile, narcissistic, tantrum-like attempt to make their opponents look worse and worse while making themselves look better. Marketing aims to present a product in the best light possible. There is some leeway in the creative process. The problem arises when dramatization crosses the line into falsely representing a product. Hefty fines can result from false advertising when levied by the authorities.\\n\\nMarketing and advertising are ingrained in the modern culture, from children’s programs on Saturday mornings to talk shows and prime-time TV. Advertising even invades movies through product placement. Marketing influences how people feel about themselves and often turns out negative. Widespread concern exists about the potential effects of media portrayals of drinking, alcohol product placements, and alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and problems among young people. Television, radio, film, and popular music are often identified as potential sources through which young people learn about alcohol and as possible influences on young people’s drinking and drinking problems. Even though campaign advertising has been a part of politics, scholars are still conflicted over the effects of different advertising strategies. As a result, the literature on political advertising is vast and multifaceted. Conventional wisdom holds that political advertising, in general, is harmful to democracy. Further, the adverse effects of advertising on teenagers include increased cigarette and alcohol use, obesity, poor nutrition, and eating disorders, according to Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\\n\\nAdvertisers are traditionally using techniques to which children and adolescents are more susceptible, such as product placement in TV shows and tie-ins between movies and fast-food restaurants, to mention a few. It’s all kid’s play anyway, with today’s youngsters having profound influence over purchases in all product categories. Many marketing evils lure people into buying even when not required. However, the picture of the relationship between marketing and society is contested. Marketing has often been criticized for encouraging excessive consumption, self-indulgent lifestyle, and producing a consumer culture where products and services are the core of social identity at the expense of other ‘traditional’ values.\\n\\nJust as in an underdeveloped economy, marketing can be an avenue for publicity of indigenous products and services, thereby generating income; similarly, in developing and developed economies, where competition for the share of the customer’s pocket is high, marketing can lead to attitudinal and lifestyle changes and problems. Free collectible coupons or tattoos inside chips packets, and other such advertising gimmicks and tactics do not add any value to the product being offered but only lure consumers into buying a product they otherwise may not have purchased- leading to another group of people who entice these students to enroll for a weight reduction program! Sex is used in commercials to sell everything from beer to shampoo to cars. New research shows that teenagers’ exposure to sexual content in the media may be responsible for the earlier onset of sexual intercourse or other sexual activities leading to an increased number of HIV-positive cases.\\n\\nAlcohol producers spend $ 5.7 billion/per year on advertising and promotions. Research has found that adolescent drinkers are more likely to have been exposed to alcohol advertising. Studies confirm a direct link between junk food advertisements and obesity among adolescents.\\n\\nAs we move ahead with technology and change the marketing strategy with the growing consumerism, it is vital to be cautious. Our cautiousness can only decide what happens in the future regarding marketing.</td>\n",

              "      <td>How advertisement/marketing affects business. | Blackcoffer Insights We are living in 2022 and everything has changed post the years. The whole world is running on two phenomena, either #technology or marketing. In a simple sense, earlier if we had to buy something our choice was clear with respect to the product, its price, brand, even shops from where to purchase, and more such factors. There were not many alternates and substitutes available in the market for anything. But now the scenario has changed and we could find ample alternates and substitutes available in the market and not only that, even we have alternatives to markets as well. Now we even have a choice among the mode of the market to choose from, i.e. either physical market or virtual market. Simultaneously the competition between the businesses has also risen. So a question arises, in such a competitive and dynamic environment how do businesses sustain themselves?\\n\\nThe only solution to this question is ADVERTISEMENT / MARKETING. Marketing plays a very important role in the #success and failure of any company. Marketing philosophy is implemented to attract new and existing customers towards their product/service or company. The very common tool used for marketing is advertising. The basic idea behind advertising is to give customers knowledgeable about the product or service in a very interesting and attractive way.\\n\\nAny company should opt for the advertisement model very judiciously. The advertisement tells customers which product they should buy and which to leave. Advertisement affects businesses in a very crucial way as they decide whether a product is ready to play in long run or not. Most of the products are chosen by the customers because of the advertisement only. If businesses don’t advertise then no one will buy their products. Advertisements are the main reason behind the revenues of a company. There are many ways to do advertise through electronic mediums such as televisions, radio, social media, etc., and paper mediums such as newspapers.\\n\\nWrong advertisements can be harmful to businesses as they provide information in the wrong manner. Instead of being the needs of people, it becomes unnecessary for the people. This could result in a big loss for the company and may also hamper the image of the company. For example, TATA introduced the Nano car in India to have low price car but its marketing went wrong in the eyes of the public and it got failed.\\n\\nSo advertising/marketing affects a business in both positive and negative ways.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Rising IT cities will impact the economy, environment, infrastructure, and city life by the year 2035 | Blackcoffer Insights 2035,urbanizationhas changed the world as well as the country. India, the world’s third-largest economy after America with China already surpassing the USA and India surpassing Japan to become a larger #economy is now behind China in terms of urbanization with 675 million people living in urbanized cities as compared to China which has 1bn people living in urbanized cities. But what is the cost of urbanization?Social cost? Is it positive or negative? Has it eased our leaving or are we becoming moreAI-driven?\\n\\nTechnologyhas always been the driving force for any change in society be it from theindustrialrevolutionin the 18th century to the advancement of the Internet. The world has changed massively and is continuously changing with citiestransforminginto smart ones with more #opportunities and #betterment oflife. Cities change the future and they are the #engines of economic growth and modernization. With half of the world now living in #urban cities. It is this urbanization that is changing the trajectory ofgrowthmiraculously. The present cities which are in the top 10 with the highest #GDP share might not be there in the list of 2035. A report by Oxford Economics claims that most of the cities will be from Asia with New York and London still being the leader as it has deep roots inbankingandfinanceinstitutes. Likewise, Population anddemographicscan become major assets to a country’s growth. India’s burgeoning working-age demographics will present a #unique advantage for themselves and the country is projected to contain several of the fastest-growing cities in the coming years. If we talk about the annual GDP growth rate of the cities which are likely to top the charts, it is also a surprise for the West. Not a single city is from the West anymore but all are from the Asian block, mainly dominated by India and China, and some cities from Southeast Asia. Bangalore with a massive GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent leads the pack followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore has a colossal amount of talent pool and the startup culture makes it unique on its own. It is safe to say the next Silicon Valley of Asia and the world is Bangalore itself. The amount of startups it generates now is huge. It has the potential to be one of the most urbanized cities in the world. The annual average GDP growth of the entire world, which will be around 2.5 percent, is very minimal for these cities which will surpass it by a fair amount.\\n\\nSurely countries will grow as well as cities will be modernized to cater to the needs of society. Migration from rural to urban has been a key reason for the expansion of urban cities. But if we can maintain a balance between both the environment and sustainable growth, the future would be better for us as well as our future generations. Climate change is real and it’s affecting us. The impacts of climate change will lead to a worsening of environmental conditions in vast regions in the form of extended heat episodes, more erratic rainfall, drought, and flooding. As we are seeing in Europe, China, and Pakistan. Heatwaves in the entire continent of Europe have caused problems in society, likewise, China is experiencing severe heat waves in the country causing rivers to dry up due to which hydroelectricity cannot be generated. Pakistan witnessed an unprecedented amount of floods in the region. Out of 160 districts,110 districts are underwater and a loss of almost 10bn dollars.  These impacts particularly affect rural agrarian and pastoralist communities of society which heavily depend on the environment. With livelihoods being increasingly disrupted by climate change across the globe, climate-driven migration will likely increase. According to the World Bank Groundswell report, Sub-Saharan, and Southeast Asia could see more than 130 million people move within their countries’ making it a massive amount of migration if no urgent global and national climate actions are taken right now.(Rigaud et al., 2018) Urbanization also affects the broader prospects of regional environments. Regions downwind from large industrial complexes also see huge increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the number of days with thunderstorms. Urban areas generate more rain, but they reduce the infiltration of water and thus lower the water tables.\\n\\nEnergy consumption for electricity, transportation, cooking, and heating is much higher in urban areas than in rural villages. For example, urban populations nowadays have more cars than rural populations. Almost all of the cars in the world in the 1930s were in the country of the United States. Today we have a car for every two people in that country. China, the United States, and India are the top three countries that contribute to the global greenhouse emitter. If that becomes the norm, in 2050 there would be almost 5.3 billion cars in the world, all using the energy of cars and destroying the environment with their global emission.\\n\\nA large share of migrants will be moving to cities. In many countries, including the G20 ones, urbanization processes are driven by rural-urban migration in response to rapid changes in production, especially manufacturing. India is now trying to catch up with manufacturing after becoming successful in the service sector as it sees an opportunity in front of them. With China 2035 moving towards a more AI-based service sector, it will be the young population of India that will cater to the needs of the world.  Better labor market prospects in urban areas pull in young people, while lack of social and economic opportunities as well as environmental drivers of the society push people out of their rural origins to search for a better and higher standard of living in the urban centers. As a consequence, G20 countries like China, India, and South Africa have seen major urban growth in the past decades. People who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than the residents of rural areas. For example, urban populations consume much more amounts of food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. In China during the 1970s, the urban populations also consumed more than twice as much pork as the rural populations who were raising pigs. With economic development, people now have declined their consumption as the rural populations of the countries ate better diets.\\n\\nThe health implications of environmental problems include respiratory infections and other infectious and parasitic diseases. Capital costs for building improved environmental infrastructure are also costly for example, investments in a cleaner public transportation system such as a subway — and for building more hospitals and clinics are higher in cities than people in rural areas, where wages exceed those paid in rural areas and also the cost to avail the services are much higher in urban cities than in rural areas.\\n\\nInfrastructure does play an important role in the process of urbanization. India, which is now aiming toward a 5 trillion economy, is building up a huge infrastructure to support the economy. Infrastructure like roads, bridges, and railway networks are the veins of an economy. Just like China created a pool of massive infrastructures to support the economy  Being a developing country India has to prioritize sectors for their both inclusive as well as exclusive growth and as India moves towards a manufacturing hub, India needs to move towards better network and fast-paced network to support the movement of logistics  Often it is said- roads are the true mirror of the economy as India is moving from highways to expressways it needs to sustain these changes so that shortly you have infrastructures ready to move ahead in leaps and bounds. Therefore, to enable macroeconomic stabilization through the expansion of revenue expenditure, ring-fencing of capital expenditure levels as a share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) becomes critical.\\n\\nOf course, any number of variables could impact these projections of 2035, from financial recessions to wars, food securities to pandemics, and political uncertainty to rapid urbanization and technological advances.\\n\\nBut one thing’s certain— it is in these coming decades, cities are where many of these factors will converge and play out on the world stage.</td>\n",

This can improve the quality of life for these individuals and reduce the risk of complications from their conditions.\\n\\nIncreased flexibility for patients and healthcare providers: Telemedicine allows patients and providers to schedule consultations at times convenient for them, improving the overall flexibility of the healthcare system. This can help to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.\\n\\nIncreased accessibility: Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible to people living in rural and remote areas, who may not have easy access to medical facilities. With telemedicine, patients can consult with doctors and specialists from their homes using their phones, computers, or other devices. This means that more people will be able to get the medical care they need, regardless of where they live.\\n\\nReduced costs: One of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is that it can reduce healthcare costs. Patients can avoid the costs of travel, accommodation, and time off work associated with in-person visits to the doctor. Telemedicine can also help reduce the cost of medical procedures, as doctors can remotely monitor patients and provide care without needing hospitalization.\\n\\nImproved health outcomes: By providing patients with access to medical care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help improve their health outcomes. For example, patients with chronic conditions can use telemedicine to manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. Telemedicine can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, as patients can receive care without contacting other people.\\n\\nIncreased convenience: Telemedicine offers a more convenient option for patients who need medical care. With telemedicine, patients can schedule appointments and consult with doctors at a convenient time without having to take time off work or arrange transportation. This can be especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or mobility issues.\\n\\nTelemedicine, or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system, providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people.\\n\\nThe benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients, it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers, telemedicine can reduce the strain on already-overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible.\\n\\nThe rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040, it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape, with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely.\\n\\nOne of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high-speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past, the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor, making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However, with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools, telemedicine consultations are just as good as in-person visits.\\n\\nTelemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine, patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead, they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas, where access to healthcare can be limited.\\n\\nAnother factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer, the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time.\\n\\nAnother substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors, telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example, a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient’s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment.\\n\\nTelemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes, telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition, telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases, reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization.\\n\\nOne of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes, telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition, telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need.\\n\\nAnother way in which telemedicine will impact people’s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely, telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors’ spending on administrative tasks, freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care.\\n\\nOne major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology, it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing, remote monitoring, and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it.\\n\\nAnother factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas; patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances, saving them time and money.\\n\\nFinally, telemedicine’s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations, the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes, reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider.\\n\\nOverall, the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors, including the increasing use of technology in healthcare, the need for improved access to healthcare, and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve, likely, telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape.\\n\\nHowever, the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example, telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions, and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally, telemedicine may put some jobs at risk, such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.  \n",

            Rise of e-health and its impact on humans by the year 2030 | Blackcoffer Insights The rise of e-health, or the use of electronic means to facilitate health care, has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. The use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. By 2030, it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare, and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e-health on humans by that year.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of e-health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. With the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies, patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas, where access to healthcare providers may be limited. It can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. By 2030, it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it.\\n\\nIn addition to increasing access to care, e-health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies, healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information, streamlining the process of providing care. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans, and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. By 2030, it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread, potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system.\\n\\nAnother potential impact of e-health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization, healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally, the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health, potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations.\\n\\nWhile the potential benefits of e-health are significant, there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches, which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e-health to exacerbate healthcare disparities, as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e-health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e-health continues to grow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, by 2030 it is likely that e-health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. The increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e-health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. However, it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks, such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities, as the use of e-health continues to grow.  \n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It’s not an overnight change, but more like how summer turns into fall – gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040? I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all, what is telemedicine? It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another.\\n\\nRole of tele-med during a pandemic\\n\\nTelemedicine’s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, Intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.\\n\\nAdvantages of Telemed in today’s era\\n\\nPatients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. There’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.\\n\\nRise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic\\n\\nSource: The Indian Express\\n\\nThis step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.\\n\\nOur consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (Exhibit 2).\\n\\nAround 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID-19.\\n\\nIts impact on human beings over the years\\n\\nMoreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 However, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.\\n\\nIncreasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights:\\n\\n“ Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”\\n\\nAccess to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.\\n\\nIs the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?\\n\\nThe trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.\\n\\nRole of business leaders in achieving new model\\n\\nWhen creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.\\n\\nBusinesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now.\\n\\nSumming it up\\n\\nLowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well, the transition to a tele-driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance, it could take decades—if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.  \n",

The ubiquitous smartphone, capable of video interactions, can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals, for example, Intermountain’s’s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in-person clinics and offices, psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in-person visits.\\n\\nAdvantages of Telemed in today’s era\\n\\nPatients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two-pronged nightmare. There’s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next, wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance, telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan.\\n\\nRise of the telemedicine industry post-pandemic\\n\\nSource: The Indian Express\\n\\nThis step-change, borne out of necessity, was enabled by these factors: 1) increased consumer willingness to use telehealth, 2) increased provider willingness to use telehealth, and 3) regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic, telehealth offered a bridge to care, and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in-person care models, with a goal of improved healthcare access, outcomes, and affordability.\\n\\nOur consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs, but—as expected—this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall, consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties (Exhibit 2).\\n\\nAround 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward—up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID-19.\\n\\nIts impact on human beings over the years\\n\\nMoreover, our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions, such as a “digital front door” or lower-cost virtual-first health plan.6 However, a gap has historically existed between consumers’ expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface, breaking down silos in care provision (across virtual and in-person) with improved data integration and insights, and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes.\\n\\nIncreasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health, improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends, those with chronic and mental health issues, and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021, we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID-19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights:\\n\\n“ Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly, consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre-COVID-19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed, fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating.”\\n\\nAccess to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead, substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic.\\n\\nIs the rise in tele-med industry temporary or will keep growing?\\n\\nThe trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas, such as urgent care and specialty care, patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward, there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike.\\n\\nRole of business leaders in achieving new model\\n\\nWhen creating a new model of health care, the hard work is in the details, and because a tele-driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery, developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design, shape, and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article, but here are two major considerations: reimbursement and care delivery requisites.\\n\\nBusinesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid-19 struck, sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals, experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5% annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical-cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now.\\n\\nSumming it up\\n\\nLowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well, the transition to a tele-driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance, it could take decades—if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.  \n",

Many scholars believe that Artificial Intelligence(AI) has been the most pioneering innovation since early humans discovered fire and invented the wheel. The advancement of groundbreaking technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) have constantly been shaping the future of humankind. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg have welcomed the evolution of AI. He once stated- “With A.I.especially, I am optimistic“. While according to Elon Musk, “AI can outsmart and endanger us.”However, we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential AI is in our daily lives.\\n\\nThe applications of AI and ML have delved deeply into various domains. The least to mention are Healthcare, Transportation, Education, Media, Communication, Manufacturing, andCustomer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers’ overall experiences. As a result of AI, a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots.\\n\\nChatbots are AI-based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls, FAQs, and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7, enhancing the customer experience.\\n\\nThe use of technologies such as AI, ML, and NLP (Natural Language Processing), enables the bot to analyze and identify the user’s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries.\\n\\nPlatforms such as Facebook Messenger, WeChat, Discord, and Slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication.\\n\\nThere are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses- Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day, which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore, chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly, and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML-based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies.\\n\\nRoughly 40 % of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology, chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come.\\n\\nAccording to some reports, it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 26% from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021, the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million.\\n\\nIt is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market.\\n\\nIn the past few years, some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology, the tech giants like Apple, Amazon, and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, respectively.\\n\\nDeep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue, conducting research, generating leads, and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation.\\n\\nGiven the trends of the data, we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion-dollar mark in a few years. Hence, by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi-billion dollar market value.\\n\\nBank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced “Erica” is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments, check their balances, save money, and transfer funds with this chatbot, which uses artificial intelligence, algorithms, and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice, and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer.\\n\\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers’ right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger, so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details, boarding passes, and flight status updates. On a typical day, KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic, that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute.\\n\\nThese innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040, chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain.\\n\\nThere are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI-driven chatbots are used with customers, even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers.\\n\\nThe availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer’s data is also a key challenge.\\n\\nEven though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function, there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi-folds by 2040.

It appears that industry leaders and marketing professionals, not academics, were the first to adopt the word. To bring the promises, principles, and excitement (and hype) surrounding e-commerce (electronic commerce) to the health arena and to give an account of the new possibilities the Internet is opening up for the area of health care, they created and used this term in line with other “e-words” such as e-commerce, e-business, e-solutions, and so on.\\n\\nE-health emerged in the modern world as a result of the demand for better patient tracking of their healthcare and operations, notably for purposes of reimbursement from organizations like insurance companies. In the past, healthcare professionals kept paper records of the patient’s history and current condition. However, the development of an electronic tracking system was pushed by rising healthcare expenses and technological advancements. The field of telemedicine, in which a telecommunications medium is utilized to deliver medical care remotely, evolved as e-health technology advanced.\\n\\nGrowth of E-health\\n\\nThe e-health industry saw tremendous expansion following the epidemic, with several new companies being created as “buddies” for e-health treatment. such as the market leaders in a positive way right now, Oura Health, Vantage Health, Mendelian, and HealthifyMe. They target those who are looking for economical healthcare facilities by offering E-health at lower prices. Accessibility from the East is another aspect of e-health care brands. Some benefits of e-health care facilities include quality, improved doctor-patient relationships, a wider audience, better communication, tracking of health, and convenience of follow-ups.\\n\\nImpact of technology on E-health\\n\\nThe recently introduced 5G services will present an ocean of chances for e-health services, according to a study by “EY.” In addition to accelerating the deployment of telemedicine, 5G may improve the interaction between health sensors, algorithms, and smart gadgets.\\n\\nIn 2021, the size of the global e-health market was estimated at USD 97,640.4 million. By 2030, it is anticipated to reach USD 338,147.7 million, expanding at a CAGR of 14.8% over the forecast period (2022-2030). As we can see, the fast-expanding e-health sector is changing how healthcare is provided. This caused a large portion of the population to switch from conventional healthcare practices to electronic health. Now, more and more nations are looking for a digital strategy. The market is expanding as a result of rising government measures to encourage e-health solutions, an increase in chronic diseases, and a growing requirement to employ e-health to manage regulatory compliance.\\n\\nRise of E-health in today’s world\\n\\nAccording to a poll of more than 11,000 consumers across 16 nations, consumers still view health and fitness as “essentials,” right up there with groceries and domestic cleaning supplies, even in the face of general insecurity and financial difficulties. 80% of poll participants indicated they intended to maintain or increase their spending on areas connected to health and fitness in the coming year, such as exercise classes or vitamins and supplements, even though two-thirds (66%) of respondents stated they feel financially stressed.\\n\\nSource: Accenture consumer public survey\\n\\nRegardless of income levels, people have redefined health and well-being as essential goods and intend to maintain or increase their spending in this area this year, according to Oliver Wright, a senior managing director at Accenture and the global leader of the company’s Consumer Goods & Services industry practice. “With the global spend on health and wellness expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2025, consumer-facing companies must draw on cross-industry expertise, scientific advancements, and technological innovations while also taking consumers’ shifting priorities into account when developing new offerings.” Thus, as health requirements rise along with innovation, people are more tolerant of e-health.\\n\\nSource: Deloitte\\n\\nHealthcare customers desire both easy access to medical care and positive interactions with their doctors. However, if forced to pick one, they would go with convenience. To address this, more than half of the survey participants expressed interest in implementing solutions that would enhance the consumer experience by lowering the time and difficulty associated with obtaining care. In fact, over the next three to five years, 61% of respondents intend to spend money on patient communication technologies like telehealth and messaging capabilities with their medical staff. Other consumer-specific capabilities that businesses are wanting to invest in at this time include online appointment scheduling and virtual registration.\\n\\nFuture of E-health and its role in the Pandemic\\n\\nThe system of E-health relies on interoperable digital systems to exchange information on health operations, and in the future, information from these systems might be exchanged between other nations to enhance healthcare administration. This enables inhabitants of one country who travel elsewhere for a vacation to receive better healthcare and medicine prescriptions there. Additionally, this will help the medical tourism sector as well.\\n\\nRobotics and artificial intelligence will be used more frequently in the future. Even though it will be difficult in the future for robots to operate on people, doctors are now utilizing AI to diagnose illnesses. The goal of digital healthcare in the future is to put medical facilities close to the people. M-health technologies can track patients’ vital signs and keep an eye out for anomalies. so that consumers can consult a doctor before the issue worsens This lowers the fatality rate and medical malpractice.\\n\\nThe covid-19 pandemic has already demonstrated the value of e-health technology since most hospitals were operating at limited capacity and postponing procedures as a result. As a result, during the epidemic, E-health applications were employed to maintain communication and improve patient care. All of this technology was, however, interoperable and required fast internet connections. To reduce the distance between doctors and patients, internet penetration would rise in the future, for instance with today’s 5G technology.\\n\\nSumming it up\\n\\nLast but not least, a stronger push for digital health may increase confidence in digital healthcare and increase dependence on medical websites. The vaccination movement, which is highly vocal and gaining traction through digital channels, is an example of this. The relationship between the medical staff and the patient is ultimately what drives health and wellness, but in today’s environment, digital platforms are supporting this interaction more than ever. The future standard of treatment might very well include the routine use of digital health instruments.  \n",

It includes influencers creating content by interacting with the product or services offered or with the employee of the business. Influencer marketing yields better results than conventional celebrity endorsements. They can easily interact with their followers which results in better engagement. Influencer marketing plays a significant role in consumer behavior and psychology such as recommendations.

Amazon makes use of users’ browsing and purchasing history while displaying products when we log in to it. Spotify Wrapped is one of the music streaming service’s most effective content marketing initiatives.

Understanding consumer behavior is the key secret to reaching out to more customers for brand recognition, engaging with the clients, and converting those into potential buyers.\\n\\nHow marketing influences consumer decisions?\\n\\nThe primary responsibility of a marketing department is to grow the market share by acquiring and keeping new clients. The best way to do that is by monitoring, evaluating, and controlling consumer behavior. Modern marketing strategies easily handle this duty. Let’s examine the how and why in more detail.\\n\\nRegularly held marketing initiatives have a significant impact on consumers’ purchase decisions. They pick one brand over another just because they saw the first one’s advertisement more frequently. Customers tend to trust some businesses more than others simply because they have better blogs, and more visually appealing material and employ opinion leaders who help customers associate with the company favorably.\\n\\nInstead of informing consumers, modern marketing aims to convince and build strong emotional bonds with brands and products. Even if people can’t recall where or when they saw a specific advertisement, they may still experience a specific emotion when they look at a product at a store, such as happiness, comfort, or confidence. It occurs because the advertising they watched caused their brain to detect a particular emotion. The brain immediately connected the product with a certain emotion when they first viewed it. When buyers select from a variety of comparable products from various companies, this relationship will operate flawlessly.\\n\\nNike advertises in a way that makes its customers comfortable. Its tagline, “Just Do It,” speaks for itself. Allowing everybody and everyone to come up with their meaning of the term makes it straightforward but to the point and helps the business build relationships with its customers. The audience is emotionally connected to this slogan.\\n\\nWe believe that each of our social, professional, and informational settings is distinct. But in reality, we all live in a world of marketing where everything is offered for sale and purchased. It’s not good or bad; it’s simply the new commercial reality that dictates what you’ll wear tomorrow, how you’ll address your boss, and how much of your income you’ll spend on eating out. With a few notable exceptions, it is generally applicable to everyone, from a young wealthy nerd who is only 20 years old to a family in their late 30s. If you give it some more thought, you’ll realize that most of the material you encounter each day attempts to sell you something, such as a good, idea, an emotion, a political viewpoint, a way of acting, etc. Marketing strategies and tactics in all their forms and guises are what produce this entire environment.\\n\\nTake, for instance, the blogs of modern businesses. Rather than being sales tools, they appear to be thematic media. Companies work to position themselves as the go-to resource for information about a given industry by disseminating their knowledge of it to consumers. In this approach, they produce a ton of content, including viral material that shapes consumer trends and purchasing patterns. Today, public perception and reputation are even more valuable than actual goods. If it has a worthwhile message to convey and is effectively promoted, even a plain chicken egg can become viral and break Instagram records.\\n\\nSource-Instagram\\n\\nBecause it informs, equalizes, supports, engages, sells, and expands a business’s operations and offers, marketing is crucial for enterprises. It is equally important in the sense that it greatly influences the potential consumer behavior of the individual. If done correctly marketing can create a huge influence on both businesses and consumers.  \n",

The various conventional marketing tools are advertising, branding, direct marketing, sales promotion, publicity, and public relations. Critics acknowledge that marketing has legitimate uses in as much as it connects goods and services to consumers who desire them. However, some aspects of marketing, especially promotion and advertisements, are subject to criticism. They argue that product promotion is an attempt by the goods and service providers to influence demand. Advertising has become such an inextricable part of our lives that one cannot imagine life without it. Although we hardly ever notice, advertisements leave an indelible mark on our minds, especially on vulnerable groups like children and adolescents.\\n\\nThe commensuration of the two words raises eyebrows in marketing and society, as it is highly debatable. On the one hand, Society thrives on Companies’ marketing efforts, while another school of thought argues that marketing makes society more materialistic. Today, striking a balance between the two is the challenge marketers face. Ethical expectations are a vital part of the business environment. Society expects businesses to be honest and desires corporate executives, at all levels, to apply ethical principles- in other words, guidelines as to what is right and wrong, fair and unfair, and morally correct- when they make business decisions. For better or worse, marketing is everywhere, with the allure of new products, big promises, and hope for something new or different. As we turn on the television or scroll through social media feeds, we will find it hard to avoid someone trying to sell us something. While advertising and marketing share information and tell us what is new, it does so to persuade rather than educate, so their influence can sometimes be more harmful than positive.\\n\\nThe debate about the positives and negatives of advertising is a bit like the infamous chicken or egg question. Some people claim that marketing causes adverse effects, while others argue that it merely reflects what is already happening in the culture. For all the positive potential of marketing, the reality is that it frequently influences society in negative ways. One negative aspect of marketing is its potential to feed into unrealistic expectations, breed discontentment, and influence our thought processes in ways beyond our control. Materialism, workaholism, unhealthy lifestyle habits, alcoholism, politics, and unrealistic views negatively shape our culture and impact the most vulnerable.\\n\\nAccording to research, marketing has become increasingly hostile in the modern television era. Consumers are often disturbed by advertisements & marketing, and negative campaign ads tend to fuel a vicious cycle where both sides fling ads back and forth in a futile, narcissistic, tantrum-like attempt to make their opponents look worse and worse while making themselves look better. Marketing aims to present a product in the best light possible. There is some leeway in the creative process. The problem arises when dramatization crosses the line into falsely representing a product. Hefty fines can result from false advertising when levied by the authorities.\\n\\nMarketing and advertising are ingrained in the modern culture, from children’s programs on Saturday mornings to talk shows and prime-time TV. Advertising even invades movies through product placement. Marketing influences how people feel about themselves and often turns out negative. Widespread concern exists about the potential effects of media portrayals of drinking, alcohol product placements, and alcohol advertising on alcohol consumption and problems among young people. Television, radio, film, and popular music are often identified as potential sources through which young people learn about alcohol and as possible influences on young people’s drinking and drinking problems. Even though campaign advertising has been a part of politics, scholars are still conflicted over the effects of different advertising strategies. As a result, the literature on political advertising is vast and multifaceted. Conventional wisdom holds that political advertising, in general, is harmful to democracy. Further, the adverse effects of advertising on teenagers include increased cigarette and alcohol use, obesity, poor nutrition, and eating disorders, according to Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\\n\\nAdvertisers are traditionally using techniques to which children and adolescents are more susceptible, such as product placement in TV shows and tie-ins between movies and fast-food restaurants, to mention a few. It’s all kid’s play anyway, with today’s youngsters having profound influence over purchases in all product categories. Many marketing evils lure people into buying even when not required. However, the picture of the relationship between marketing and society is contested. Marketing has often been criticized for encouraging excessive consumption, self-indulgent lifestyle, and producing a consumer culture where products and services are the core of social identity at the expense of other ‘traditional’ values.\\n\\nJust as in an underdeveloped economy, marketing can be an avenue for publicity of indigenous products and services, thereby generating income; similarly, in developing and developed economies, where competition for the share of the customer’s pocket is high, marketing can lead to attitudinal and lifestyle changes and problems. Free collectible coupons or tattoos inside chips packets, and other such advertising gimmicks and tactics do not add any value to the product being offered but only lure consumers into buying a product they otherwise may not have purchased- leading to another group of people who entice these students to enroll for a weight reduction program! Sex is used in commercials to sell everything from beer to shampoo to cars. New research shows that teenagers’ exposure to sexual content in the media may be responsible for the earlier onset of sexual intercourse or other sexual activities leading to an increased number of HIV-positive cases.\\n\\nAlcohol producers spend $ 5.7 billion/per year on advertising and promotions. Research has found that adolescent drinkers are more likely to have been exposed to alcohol advertising. Studies confirm a direct link between junk food advertisements and obesity among adolescents.\\n\\nAs we move ahead with technology and change the marketing strategy with the growing consumerism, it is vital to be cautious. Our cautiousness can only decide what happens in the future regarding marketing.  \n",

The whole world is running on two phenomena, either #technology or marketing. In a simple sense, earlier if we had to buy something our choice was clear with respect to the product, its price, brand, even shops from where to purchase, and more such factors. There were not many alternates and substitutes available in the market for anything. But now the scenario has changed and we could find ample alternates and substitutes available in the market and not only that, even we have alternatives to markets as well. Now we even have a choice among the mode of the market to choose from, i.e. either physical market or virtual market. Simultaneously the competition between the businesses has also risen. So a question arises, in such a competitive and dynamic environment how do businesses sustain themselves?\\n\\nThe only solution to this question is ADVERTISEMENT / MARKETING. Marketing plays a very important role in the #success and failure of any company. Marketing philosophy is implemented to attract new and existing customers towards their product/service or company. The very common tool used for marketing is advertising. The basic idea behind advertising is to give customers knowledgeable about the product or service in a very interesting and attractive way.\\n\\nAny company should opt for the advertisement model very judiciously. The advertisement tells customers which product they should buy and which to leave. Advertisement affects businesses in a very crucial way as they decide whether a product is ready to play in long run or not. Most of the products are chosen by the customers because of the advertisement only. If businesses don’t advertise then no one will buy their products. Advertisements are the main reason behind the revenues of a company. There are many ways to do advertise through electronic mediums such as televisions, radio, social media, etc., and paper mediums such as newspapers.\\n\\nWrong advertisements can be harmful to businesses as they provide information in the wrong manner. Instead of being the needs of people, it becomes unnecessary for the people. This could result in a big loss for the company and may also hamper the image of the company. For example, TATA introduced the Nano car in India to have low price car but its marketing went wrong in the eyes of the public and it got failed.\\n\\nSo advertising/marketing affects a business in both positive and negative ways.  \n",

India, the world’s third-largest economy after America with China already surpassing the USA and India surpassing Japan to become a larger #economy is now behind China in terms of urbanization with 675 million people living in urbanized cities as compared to China which has 1bn people living in urbanized cities. But what is the cost of urbanization?Social cost? Is it positive or negative? Has it eased our leaving or are we becoming moreAI-driven?\\n\\nTechnologyhas always been the driving force for any change in society be it from theindustrialrevolutionin the 18th century to the advancement of the Internet. The world has changed massively and is continuously changing with citiestransforminginto smart ones with more #opportunities and #betterment oflife. Cities change the future and they are the #engines of economic growth and modernization. With half of the world now living in #urban cities. It is this urbanization that is changing the trajectory ofgrowthmiraculously. The present cities which are in the top 10 with the highest #GDP share might not be there in the list of 2035. A report by Oxford Economics claims that most of the cities will be from Asia with New York and London still being the leader as it has deep roots inbankingandfinanceinstitutes. Likewise, Population anddemographicscan become major assets to a country’s growth. India’s burgeoning working-age demographics will present a #unique advantage for themselves and the country is projected to contain several of the fastest-growing cities in the coming years. If we talk about the annual GDP growth rate of the cities which are likely to top the charts, it is also a surprise for the West. Not a single city is from the West anymore but all are from the Asian block, mainly dominated by India and China, and some cities from Southeast Asia. Bangalore with a massive GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent leads the pack followed by Dhaka, Mumbai, and Delhi. Bangalore has a colossal amount of talent pool and the startup culture makes it unique on its own. It is safe to say the next Silicon Valley of Asia and the world is Bangalore itself. The amount of startups it generates now is huge. It has the potential to be one of the most urbanized cities in the world. The annual average GDP growth of the entire world, which will be around 2.5 percent, is very minimal for these cities which will surpass it by a fair amount.\\n\\nSurely countries will grow as well as cities will be modernized to cater to the needs of society. Migration from rural to urban has been a key reason for the expansion of urban cities. But if we can maintain a balance between both the environment and sustainable growth, the future would be better for us as well as our future generations. Climate change is real and it’s affecting us. The impacts of climate change will lead to a worsening of environmental conditions in vast regions in the form of extended heat episodes, more erratic rainfall, drought, and flooding. As we are seeing in Europe, China, and Pakistan. Heatwaves in the entire continent of Europe have caused problems in society, likewise, China is experiencing severe heat waves in the country causing rivers to dry up due to which hydroelectricity cannot be generated. Pakistan witnessed an unprecedented amount of floods in the region. Out of 160 districts,110 districts are underwater and a loss of almost 10bn dollars.  These impacts particularly affect rural agrarian and pastoralist communities of society which heavily depend on the environment. With livelihoods being increasingly disrupted by climate change across the globe, climate-driven migration will likely increase. According to the World Bank Groundswell report, Sub-Saharan, and Southeast Asia could see more than 130 million people move within their countries’ making it a massive amount of migration if no urgent global and national climate actions are taken right now.(Rigaud et al., 2018) Urbanization also affects the broader prospects of regional environments. Regions downwind from large industrial complexes also see huge increases in the amount of air pollution, precipitation, and the number of days with thunderstorms. Urban areas generate more rain, but they reduce the infiltration of water and thus lower the water tables.\\n\\nEnergy consumption for electricity, transportation, cooking, and heating is much higher in urban areas than in rural villages. For example, urban populations nowadays have more cars than rural populations. Almost all of the cars in the world in the 1930s were in the country of the United States. Today we have a car for every two people in that country. China, the United States, and India are the top three countries that contribute to the global greenhouse emitter. If that becomes the norm, in 2050 there would be almost 5.3 billion cars in the world, all using the energy of cars and destroying the environment with their global emission.\\n\\nA large share of migrants will be moving to cities. In many countries, including the G20 ones, urbanization processes are driven by rural-urban migration in response to rapid changes in production, especially manufacturing. India is now trying to catch up with manufacturing after becoming successful in the service sector as it sees an opportunity in front of them. With China 2035 moving towards a more AI-based service sector, it will be the young population of India that will cater to the needs of the world.  Better labor market prospects in urban areas pull in young people, while lack of social and economic opportunities as well as environmental drivers of the society push people out of their rural origins to search for a better and higher standard of living in the urban centers. As a consequence, G20 countries like China, India, and South Africa have seen major urban growth in the past decades. People who live in urban areas have very different consumption patterns than the residents of rural areas. For example, urban populations consume much more amounts of food, energy, and durable goods than rural populations. In China during the 1970s, the urban populations also consumed more than twice as much pork as the rural populations who were raising pigs. With economic development, people now have declined their consumption as the rural populations of the countries ate better diets.\\n\\nThe health implications of environmental problems include respiratory infections and other infectious and parasitic diseases. Capital costs for building improved environmental infrastructure are also costly for example, investments in a cleaner public transportation system such as a subway — and for building more hospitals and clinics are higher in cities than people in rural areas, where wages exceed those paid in rural areas and also the cost to avail the services are much higher in urban cities than in rural areas.\\n\\nInfrastructure does play an important role in the process of urbanization. India, which is now aiming toward a 5 trillion economy, is building up a huge infrastructure to support the economy. Infrastructure like roads, bridges, and railway networks are the veins of an economy. Just like China created a pool of massive infrastructures to support the economy  Being a developing country India has to prioritize sectors for their both inclusive as well as exclusive growth and as India moves towards a manufacturing hub, India needs to move towards better network and fast-paced network to support the movement of logistics  Often it is said- roads are the true mirror of the economy as India is moving from highways to expressways it needs to sustain these changes so that shortly you have infrastructures ready to move ahead in leaps and bounds. Therefore, to enable macroeconomic stabilization through the expansion of revenue expenditure, ring-fencing of capital expenditure levels as a share of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) becomes critical.\\n\\nOf course, any number of variables could impact these projections of 2035, from financial recessions to wars, food securities to pandemics, and political uncertainty to rapid urbanization and technological advances.\\n\\nBut one thing’s certain— it is in these coming decades, cities are where many of these factors will converge and play out on the world stage.

Telemedicine or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people. The benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers telemedicine can reduce the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible. The rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040 it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely. One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools telemedicine consultations are just as good as in person visits. Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas where access to healthcare can be limited. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time. Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment. Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization. One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need. Another way in which telemedicine will impact people s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors spending on administrative tasks freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care. One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing remote monitoring and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances saving them time and money. Finally telemedicine s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing.

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights More gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way What do tele med means As the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce.

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights More gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way What do tele med means As the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.</td>\n",

However we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential AI is in our daily lives. The applications of AI and ML have delved deeply into various domains. The least to mention are Healthcare Transportation Education Media Communication Manufacturing andCustomer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers overall experiences. As a result of AI a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots. Chatbots are AI based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls FAQs and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7 enhancing the customer experience. The use of technologies such as AI ML and NLP Natural Language Processing enables the bot to analyze and identify the user s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries. Platforms such as Facebook Messenger WeChat Discord and Slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication. There are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies. Roughly 40 of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come. According to some reports it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of approximately 26 from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021 the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million. It is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market. In the past few years some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology the tech giants like Apple Amazon and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri Alexa and Google Assistant respectively. Deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue conducting research generating leads and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation. Given the trends of the data we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion dollar mark in a few years. Hence by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi billion dollar market value. Bank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced Erica is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments check their balances save money and transfer funds with this chatbot which uses artificial intelligence algorithms and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details boarding passes and flight status updates. On a typical day KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute. These innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040 chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain. There are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.</td>\n",

The benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers telemedicine can reduce the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible. The rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040 it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely. One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools telemedicine consultations are just as good as in person visits. Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas where access to healthcare can be limited. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time. Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment. Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization. One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need. Another way in which telemedicine will impact people s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors spending on administrative tasks freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care. One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing remote monitoring and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances saving them time and money. Finally telemedicine s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider. Overall the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors including the increasing use of technology in healthcare the need for improved access to healthcare and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve likely telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape. However the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally telemedicine may put some jobs at risk such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.   \n",

electronic means to facilitate health care has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. The use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. By 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e health on humans by that year. One of the main benefits of e health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. With the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas where access to healthcare providers may be limited. It can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. By 2030 it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it. In addition to increasing access to care e health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information streamlining the process of providing care. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. By 2030 it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system. Another potential impact of e health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations. While the potential benefits of e health are significant there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e health to exacerbate healthcare disparities as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e health continues to grow. In conclusion by 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. The increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. However it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities as the use of e health continues to grow.   \n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.   \n",

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights More gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way What do tele med means As the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all.

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights More gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way What do tele med means As the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.</td>\n",

However we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential AI is in our daily lives. The applications of AI and ML have delved deeply into various domains. The least to mention are Healthcare Transportation Education Media Communication Manufacturing andCustomer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers overall experiences. As a result of AI a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots. Chatbots are AI based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls FAQs and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7 enhancing the customer experience. The use of technologies such as AI ML and NLP Natural Language Processing enables the bot to analyze and identify the user s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries. Platforms such as Facebook Messenger WeChat Discord and Slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication. There are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies. Roughly 40 of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come. According to some reports it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of approximately 26 from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021 the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million. It is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market. In the past few years some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology the tech giants like Apple Amazon and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri Alexa and Google Assistant respectively. Deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue conducting research generating leads and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation. Given the trends of the data we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion dollar mark in a few years. Hence by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi billion dollar market value. Bank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced Erica is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments check their balances save money and transfer funds with this chatbot which uses artificial intelligence algorithms and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details boarding passes and flight status updates. On a typical day KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute. These innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040 chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain. There are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.</td>\n",

Increased accessibility Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible to people living in rural and remote areas who may not have easy access to medical facilities. With telemedicine patients can consult with doctors and specialists from their homes using their phones computers or other devices. This means that more people will be able to get the medical care they need regardless of where they live. Reduced costs One of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is that it can reduce healthcare costs. Patients can avoid the costs of travel accommodation and time off work associated with in person visits to the doctor. Telemedicine can also help reduce the cost of medical procedures as doctors can remotely monitor patients and provide care without needing hospitalization. Improved health outcomes By providing patients with access to medical care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help improve their health outcomes. For example patients with chronic conditions can use telemedicine to manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. Telemedicine can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases as patients can receive care without contacting other people. Increased convenience Telemedicine offers a more convenient option for patients who need medical care. With telemedicine patients can schedule appointments and consult with doctors at a convenient time without having to take time off work or arrange transportation. This can be especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or mobility issues. Telemedicine or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people. The benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers telemedicine can reduce the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible. The rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040 it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely. One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools telemedicine consultations are just as good as in person visits. Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas where access to healthcare can be limited. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time. Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment. Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization. One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need. Another way in which telemedicine will impact people s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors spending on administrative tasks freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care. One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing remote monitoring and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances saving them time and money. Finally telemedicine s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider. Overall the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors including the increasing use of technology in healthcare the need for improved access to healthcare and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve likely telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape. However the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally telemedicine may put some jobs at risk such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.   \n",

                                                                               Rise of e health and its impact on humans by the year 2030 Blackcoffer Insights The rise of e health or the use of electronic means to facilitate health care has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. The use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. By 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e health on humans by that year. One of the main benefits of e health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. With the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas where access to healthcare providers may be limited. It can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. By 2030 it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it. In addition to increasing access to care e health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information streamlining the process of providing care. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. By 2030 it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system. Another potential impact of e health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations. While the potential benefits of e health are significant there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e health to exacerbate healthcare disparities as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e health continues to grow. In conclusion by 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. The increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. However it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities as the use of e health continues to grow.   \n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.   \n",

Telemedicine or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people. The benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers telemedicine can reduce the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible. The rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040 it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely. One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools telemedicine consultations are just as good as in person visits. Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas where access to healthcare can be limited. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services.

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights More gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way What do tele med means As the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes.

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights More gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way What do tele med means As the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.</td>\n",

The least to mention are Healthcare Transportation Education Media Communication Manufacturing andCustomer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers overall experiences. As a result of AI a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots. Chatbots are AI based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls FAQs and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7 enhancing the customer experience. The use of technologies such as AI ML and NLP Natural Language Processing enables the bot to analyze and identify the user s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries.

There are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies. Roughly 40 of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come. According to some reports it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of approximately 26 from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021 the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million. It is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market. In the past few years some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology the tech giants like Apple Amazon and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri Alexa and Google Assistant respectively. Deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue conducting research generating leads and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation. Given the trends of the data we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion dollar mark in a few years. Hence by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi billion dollar market value. Bank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced Erica is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments check their balances save money and transfer funds with this chatbot which uses artificial intelligence algorithms and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details boarding passes and flight status updates. On a typical day KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute. These innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040 chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain. There are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.</td>\n",

              "0  Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights Telemedicine the use of technology to diagnose and treat patients remotely has been rising in recent years. With the advent of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools healthcare providers are increasingly turning to telemedicine to provide care to patients in remote or underserved areas. Telemedicine using technology to provide healthcare services remotely has recently gained popularity. With advancements in communication and medical technology it has become increasingly possible for doctors and patients to connect and interact from anywhere in the world. This has led to the rise of telemedicine which has the potential to revolutionize the way healthcare is delivered. Telemedicine The increasing focus on preventative healthcare has also driven the rise of telemedicine. As more and more people become aware of the importance of staying healthy they are looking for ways to prevent illness and maintain their health. Telemedicine allows people to monitor their health and get advice from healthcare providers without traveling to a clinic or hospital. Improved access tohealthcare One of the biggest challenges in the healthcare industry is the unequal distribution of medical resources with many remote and rural areas lacking access to quality care. Telemedicine can help bridge this gap by allowing patients in these underserved areas to connect with healthcare providers worldwide. This can give people access to specialized medical care that they would otherwise not be able to receive improving their health and overall well being. Healthcare Greater convenience and flexibility Telemedicine also offers a level ofconvenienceandflexibilitythat is impossible with traditional in person medical visits. Patients can consult with their healthcare providers from the comfort of their own homes saving time and money on travel. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who have mobility issues or who live in areas with limited access tomedical facilities. Reduced healthcare costs By enabling patients to receive care remotely telemedicine can help reduce the overall cost of healthcare. This is because telemedicine visits are generally less expensive than in person visits and can help prevent the need for more costly interventions such as hospitalizations. As a result telemedicine has the potential to make healthcare more affordable for patients and healthcare providers alike. Costs Enhanced healthcare outcomes Telemedicine can also improve patients quality of care.

This can improve the quality of life for these individuals and reduce the risk of complications from their conditions. Increased flexibility for patients and healthcare providers Telemedicine allows patients and providers to schedule consultations at times convenient for them improving the overall flexibility of the healthcare system. This can help to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction. Increased accessibility Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible to people living in rural and remote areas who may not have easy access to medical facilities. With telemedicine patients can consult with doctors and specialists from their homes using their phones computers or other devices. This means that more people will be able to get the medical care they need regardless of where they live. Reduced costs One of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is that it can reduce healthcare costs. Patients can avoid the costs of travel accommodation and time off work associated with in person visits to the doctor. Telemedicine can also help reduce the cost of medical procedures as doctors can remotely monitor patients and provide care without needing hospitalization. Improved health outcomes By providing patients with access to medical care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help improve their health outcomes. For example patients with chronic conditions can use telemedicine to manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. Telemedicine can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases as patients can receive care without contacting other people. Increased convenience Telemedicine offers a more convenient option for patients who need medical care. With telemedicine patients can schedule appointments and consult with doctors at a convenient time without having to take time off work or arrange transportation. This can be especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or mobility issues. Telemedicine or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people. The benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers telemedicine can reduce the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible. The rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040 it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely. One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools telemedicine consultations are just as good as in person visits. Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas where access to healthcare can be limited. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time. Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment. Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization. One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need. Another way in which telemedicine will impact people s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors spending on administrative tasks freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care. One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing remote monitoring and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances saving them time and money. Finally telemedicine s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider. Overall the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors including the increasing use of technology in healthcare the need for improved access to healthcare and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve likely telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape. However the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally telemedicine may put some jobs at risk such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.   \n",

                                                                               Rise of e health and its impact on humans by the year 2030 Blackcoffer Insights The rise of e health or the use of electronic means to facilitate health care has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. The use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. By 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e health on humans by that year. One of the main benefits of e health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. With the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas where access to healthcare providers may be limited. It can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. By 2030 it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it. In addition to increasing access to care e health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information streamlining the process of providing care. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. By 2030 it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system. Another potential impact of e health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations. While the potential benefits of e health are significant there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e health to exacerbate healthcare disparities as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e health continues to grow. In conclusion by 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. The increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. However it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities as the use of e health continues to grow.   \n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.   \n",

One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools telemedicine consultations are just as good as in person visits. Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas where access to healthcare can be limited. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time. Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment. Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization. One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need. Another way in which telemedicine will impact people s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors spending on administrative tasks freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care. One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing remote monitoring and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare.

By 2030 it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it. In addition to increasing access to care e health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information streamlining the process of providing care. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. By 2030 it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system. Another potential impact of e health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations. While the potential benefits of e health are significant there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e health to exacerbate healthcare disparities as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e health continues to grow. In conclusion by 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare. The increased access to care and improved efficiency provided by e health technologies have the potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry and improve health outcomes for individuals and populations. However it is important to consider and address potential challenges and drawbacks such as cybersecurity concerns and healthcare disparities as the use of e health continues to grow.</td>\n",

              "      <td>Rise of telemedicine and its Impact on Livelihood by 2040 Blackcoffer Insights More gains on quality affordability and accessibility are on the way What do tele med means As the world evolves and advances so does technology which in turn impacts our daily lives. One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.</td>\n",

In the year 2021 the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million. It is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market. In the past few years some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology the tech giants like Apple Amazon and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri Alexa and Google Assistant respectively. Deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue conducting research generating leads and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation. Given the trends of the data we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion dollar mark in a few years.

Customers can make payments check their balances save money and transfer funds with this chatbot which uses artificial intelligence algorithms and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details boarding passes and flight status updates. On a typical day KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute. These innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040 chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain. There are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.</td>\n",

This is because telemedicine visits are generally less expensive than in person visits and can help prevent the need for more costly interventions such as hospitalizations. As a result telemedicine has the potential to make healthcare more affordable for patients and healthcare providers alike. Costs Enhanced healthcare outcomes Telemedicine can also improve patients quality of care. By allowing healthcare providers to access medical records and other important information remotely telemedicine can help ensure that patients receive the most appropriate care for their needs. This can lead to better health outcomes and a higher quality of life for patients. Enhanced More significantjob opportunitiesin the healthcare industry like healthcare sector including for healthcare providers support staff and technology experts. This can provide a boost to localeconomiesand help to reduce unemployment. Jobs Better carefor chronic conditions Telemedicine can help patients with chronic conditions to manage their health more effectively allowing them to receive regular check ups and treatment without the need to travel long distances. This can improve the quality of life for these individuals and reduce the risk of complications from their conditions. Increased flexibility for patients and healthcare providers Telemedicine allows patients and providers to schedule consultations at times convenient for them improving the overall flexibility of the healthcare system. This can help to reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction. Increased accessibility Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible to people living in rural and remote areas who may not have easy access to medical facilities. With telemedicine patients can consult with doctors and specialists from their homes using their phones computers or other devices. This means that more people will be able to get the medical care they need regardless of where they live. Reduced costs One of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is that it can reduce healthcare costs. Patients can avoid the costs of travel accommodation and time off work associated with in person visits to the doctor. Telemedicine can also help reduce the cost of medical procedures as doctors can remotely monitor patients and provide care without needing hospitalization. Improved health outcomes By providing patients with access to medical care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help improve their health outcomes. For example patients with chronic conditions can use telemedicine to manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of complications. Telemedicine can also help prevent the spread of infectious diseases as patients can receive care without contacting other people. Increased convenience Telemedicine offers a more convenient option for patients who need medical care. With telemedicine patients can schedule appointments and consult with doctors at a convenient time without having to take time off work or arrange transportation. This can be especially beneficial for people with busy schedules or mobility issues. Telemedicine or the use of electronic communication and information technologies to provide healthcare services remotely has the potential to significantly impact the way we receive and deliver medical care. In the next 20 years telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of our healthcare system providing numerous benefits and improving the livelihood of many people. The benefits of telemedicine are numerous. For patients it provides convenient access to medical care without traveling long distances. It also allows for faster diagnosis and treatment and improved continuity of care. For healthcare providers telemedicine can reduce the strain on already overburdened healthcare systems and make providing care to patients in remote areas more accessible. The rise of telemedicine will likely significantly impact how we receive medical care in the future. By 2040 it is estimated that telemedicine will be a standard part of the healthcare landscape with more and more doctors using it to diagnose and treat patients remotely. One of the key drivers of the rise of telemedicine has been the increasing availability of high speed internet and improved video conferencing tools. In the past the video and audio quality of telemedicine consultations were often poor making it difficult for doctors to diagnose and treat patients accurately. However with faster internet speeds and better video conferencing tools telemedicine consultations are just as good as in person visits. Telemedicine makes healthcare more accessible. With telemedicine patients no longer travel long distances to see a doctor or specialist. Instead they can receive care from the comfort of their own home. This is particularly beneficial for people living in rural areas where access to healthcare can be limited. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the increasing demand for healthcare services. With the global population growing and people living longer the need for medical care will only continue to increase. Telemedicine offers a way for healthcare providers to meet this demand by allowing them to provide care to more patients in a shorter amount of time. Another substantial impact of telemedicine is that it can improve patient quality of care. By using technology to connect patients with doctors telemedicine can help ensure patients receive the best care possible. For example a doctor can use video conferencing to consult with a specialist or use remote monitoring devices to track a patient s vital signs. This can help doctors make more informed decisions and provide better treatment. Telemedicine also has the potential to reduce healthcare costs. By allowing patients to receive care from their homes telemedicine can reduce the need for expensive hospital visits. In addition telemedicine can help prevent the spread of infectious diseases reducing healthcare costs by avoiding hospitalization. One of the critical impacts of telemedicine is that it can improve the patient experience. By providing patients with the ability to receive care from the comfort of their own homes telemedicine can help reduce anxiety and stress. In addition telemedicine can make it easier for patients to communicate with their doctors and get the answers they need. Another way in which telemedicine will impact people s livelihoods is by making healthcare more efficient. By allowing doctors to diagnose and treat patients remotely telemedicine will help reduce the time patients spend waiting to see a doctor. It will also help reduce doctors spending on administrative tasks freeing them up to see more patients and provide better care. One major factor driving the rise of telemedicine is the increasing use of technology in healthcare. With advances in communication and medical technology it is now possible for doctors and other healthcare providers to remotely diagnose and treat patients using video conferencing remote monitoring and other forms of telemedicine. This not only allows for more efficient and convenient healthcare delivery but also enables healthcare providers to offer specialized care to patients who otherwise may not have access to it. Another factor contributing to the rise of telemedicine is the need for improved access to healthcare. Patients may travel long distances in many rural and underserved areas patients may travel long distances to access medical care. Telemedicine can bridge this gap by allowing patients in these areas to consult with healthcare providers remotely. This not only improves access to healthcare but also reduces the need for patients to travel long distances saving them time and money. Finally telemedicine s rise is also driven by the growing trend of remote work. As more and more people work from home or other remote locations the need for convenient and accessible healthcare is increasing. Telemedicine allows employees to consult with healthcare providers from their homes reducing the need for them to take time off work to visit a doctor or other healthcare provider. Overall the rise of telemedicine by 2040 is a result of a combination of factors including the increasing use of technology in healthcare the need for improved access to healthcare and the growing trend of remote work. As these factors continue to evolve likely telemedicine will likely become an increasingly important part of the healthcare landscape. However the rise of telemedicine is also likely to present some challenges. For example telemedicine consultations may only be suitable for some medical conditions and some patients may still need to see a doctor. Additionally telemedicine may put some jobs at risk such as receptionists and other administrative staff in healthcare facilities.   \n",

                                                                               Rise of e health and its impact on humans by the year 2030 Blackcoffer Insights The rise of e health or the use of electronic means to facilitate health care has been a major development in the healthcare industry in recent years. The use of technology to improve access to healthcare and make it more efficient has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about healthcare and its delivery. By 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare and this essay will explore the potential impacts of e health on humans by that year. One of the main benefits of e health is the increased access it provides to healthcare services. With the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies patients can receive care from anywhere with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for those who live in rural or underserved areas where access to healthcare providers may be limited. It can also be useful for those with mobility issues or disabilities that make it difficult for them to visit a healthcare facility in person. By 2030 it is likely that the use of telemedicine and other remote care technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a decrease in healthcare disparities and an increase in access to care for those who may have previously had difficulty accessing it. In addition to increasing access to care e health has the potential to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. By using electronic medical records and other digital technologies healthcare providers can more easily share and access patient information streamlining the process of providing care. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and treatment plans and potentially reduce the need for unnecessary or redundant tests and procedures. By 2030 it is likely that the use of electronic medical records and other digital technologies will become even more widespread potentially leading to a more efficient and effective healthcare system. Another potential impact of e health by 2030 is the ability to use data analytics to improve population health. By collecting and analyzing data on patient health and healthcare utilization healthcare providers can identify trends and patterns that may help them better understand and address the health needs of their patient populations. This could lead to the development of targeted interventions and prevention strategies that are more effective at improving population health. Additionally the use of wearable technology and other digital health devices can help individuals track and manage their own health potentially leading to improved health outcomes for individuals and populations. While the potential benefits of e health are significant there are also potential challenges and drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for cybersecurity breaches which could compromise the confidentiality and privacy of patient information. It is important for healthcare organizations to prioritize cybersecurity and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to protect patient data. Another concern is the potential for the use of e health to exacerbate healthcare disparities as those who are unable to afford or access the necessary technology may be left behind. Ensuring that e health technologies are accessible and affordable to all is an important consideration as the use of e health continues to grow. In conclusion by 2030 it is likely that e health will have a significant impact on the way we receive and provide healthcare.

One of that advancement is Telemedicine. It s not an overnight change but more like how summer turns into fall gradual yet very perceptible. We are now able to access healthcare remotely and this has huge implications for the way we access healthcare. How will people be accessing healthcare services in 2040 I believe that telehealth services will become an essential part of our everyday lives and will be easily accessible from the comfort of our own homes. But first of all what is telemedicine It is the use of telecommunications technology to transmit medical information between healthcare professionals and patients via mobile devices or computer tablets. Healthcare providers can use these devices to connect remotely with their patients to monitor their health remotely or to even treat them during emergencies without having to travel from one location to another. Role of tele med during a pandemic Telemedicine s ability to address inequities in access has been demonstrated during the pandemic. The ubiquitous smartphone capable of video interactions can be a lifeline for underserved populations. In rural areas with few mental health professionals for example Intermountain s s ability to offer virtual visits gives patients prompt access to both emergency and routine care. Early in the COVID 19 pandemic telehealth usage surged as consumers and providers sought ways to safely access and deliver healthcare. When the pandemic forced the closure of in person clinics and offices psychologists and psychiatrists across the world quickly instituted virtual visits. Telemedicine visits remained popular even after restrictions eased. Intermountain patients receiving their care virtually reported high satisfaction and were less likely to cancel appointments than patients who had scheduled in person visits. Advantages of Telemed in today s era Patients with obscure or complex medical problems often find themselves living a two pronged nightmare. There s the pain and fear of having a rare disease and the frustration of trying to find the right specialist. Patients may bounce from one local physician to the next wasting weeks or months sitting through useless appointments and enduring sleepless nights. Telemedicine offers a far better solution. Virtual technology can connect patients with the most experienced and knowledgeable doctors regardless of where they practice. By eliminating the barriers of time and distance telemedicine can help address two serious problems for patients with difficult diagnoses and rare diseases. The first is misdiagnosis. The second is long waits for a proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. Rise of the telemedicine industry post pandemic Source The Indian Express This step change borne out of necessity was enabled by these factors 1 increased consumer willingness to use telehealth 2 increased provider willingness to use telehealth and 3 regulatory changes enabling greater access and reimbursement. During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

During the tragedy of the pandemic telehealth offered a bridge to care and now offers a chance to reinvent virtual and hybrid virtual/in person care models with a goal of improved healthcare access outcomes and affordability. Our consumer research5 shows that consumers continue to view telehealth as an important modality for their future care needs but as expected this view varies widely depending on the type of care. Overall consumer perception tracks closely to what we believe is possible telehealth uptake by various specialties Exhibit 2 . Around 40 percent of surveyed consumers stated that they believe they will continue to use telehealth going forward up from 11 percent of consumers using telehealth before COVID 19. Its impact on human beings over the years Moreover our research shows between 40 and 60 percent of consumers express interest in a set of broader virtual health solutions such as a digital front door or lower cost virtual first health plan.6 However a gap has historically existed between consumers expressed interest in digital health solutions and actual usage. Continuing to focus on creating a seamless consumer interface breaking down silos in care provision across virtual and in person with improved data integration and insights and proactive consumer engagement will all be important to sustaining and growing consumer use of virtual health as the pandemic wanes. Increasing both the frequency and the scope of virtual care nationwide would transform Indian health improving the lives of patients who get sick during nights and weekends those with chronic and mental health issues and anyone who could benefit from virtual specialty care. It could save tens of thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars each year. As of July 2021 we step back to review the progress of telehealth since the initial COVID 19 spike and to assess implications for telehealth and virtual health more broadly going forward. The findings include the following insights Telehealth utilization has stabilized at levels 38X higher than before the pandemic.Similarly consumer and provider attitudes toward telehealth have improved since the pre COVID 19 era. Investment in virtual care and digital health more broadly has skyrocketed fuelling further innovation. Virtual healthcare models and business models are evolving and proliferating. Access to online primary care is growing rapidly but remains concentrated among younger patients and minorities. Despite the challenges ahead substantial opportunities lie ahead as we recover from the pandemic. Is the rise in tele med industry temporary or will keep growing The trend toward more virtual health care will continue as consumers become more comfortable with telehealth and demand more convenient ways to access care. In some areas such as urgent care and specialty care patients are starting to shift their preferences toward online solutions. Moving forward there are several important challenges and opportunities to consider to ensure that the benefits of telehealth are widely accessible to patients and providers alike. Role of business leaders in achieving new model When creating a new model of health care the hard work is in the details and because a tele driven system will affect every aspect of care delivery developing one entails thousands of decisions. Medical and financial leaders will need to design shape and implement the processes by which care will be delivered and paid for. The specifics of how best to do this are beyond the scope of this article but here are two major considerations reimbursement and care delivery requisites. Businesses will need to band together to achieve economies of scale and identify the right leadership in the surrounding medical community. Businesses might wonder whether creating a new health system merits the time and energy that would be required. They should consider that rapidly rising medical costs will significantly affect their bottom lines. Even before Covid 19 struck sparking supply chain challenges and exacerbating the shortage of healthcare professionals experts predicted that healthcare spending would increase by 5.5 annually. Businesses can expect extremely high medical cost inflation if nothing is done. The time to act is now. Summing it up Lowering medical costs while maximizing the health of employees is the best way for businesses to stay profitable and maintain a loyal workforce. The pandemic has highlighted the opportunities that exist and the problems that will worsen if nothing changes. Done well the transition to a tele driven health system could be accomplished in a few years. If left to chance it could take decades if it happens at all. The current crisis offers a unique opportunity to build a better future for our healthcare system. But we must act quickly.   \n",

Many scholars believe that Artificial Intelligence AI has been the most pioneering innovation since early humans discovered fire and invented the wheel. The advancement of groundbreaking technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning ML have constantly been shaping the future of humankind. The likes of Mark Zuckerberg have welcomed the evolution of AI. He once stated With A.I.especially I am optimistic . While according to Elon Musk AI can outsmart and endanger us. However we simply cannot ignore how useful and influential AI is in our daily lives. The applications of AI and ML have delved deeply into various domains. The least to mention are Healthcare Transportation Education Media Communication Manufacturing andCustomer service. Businesses worldwide are placing a significant emphasis on enhancing their customers overall experiences. As a result of AI a massive leap in customer experience service has come up with the evolution of chatbots. Chatbots are AI based systems used by businesses for communication with customers. Customers can interact with chatbots directly via chat and voice applications. Numerous online customer service platforms are utilizing chatbots to manage bulk phone calls FAQs and other common customer service inquiries. Chatbots resolve customer queries within no time and are accessible 24X7 enhancing the customer experience. The use of technologies such as AI ML and NLP Natural Language Processing enables the bot to analyze and identify the user s problems and instantly give the most relevant answers to the queries. Platforms such as Facebook Messenger WeChat Discord and Slack have been extensively using chatbots for better communication. There are numerous advantages of using chatbots in businesses Chatbots can communicate with multiple customers at once. They can be used to send regular updates about the products and exclusive offers by the company. They are available throughout the day which is crucial for businesses that expand globally in different time zones. It becomes too cumbersome for businesses to have customer care support centers at various locations across the world. There is no human intervention involved. Therefore chatbots can be accessed worldwide anytime. Chatbots reply instantly and hence it increases customer engagement. Chatbots can also be extensively used to collect user data and analyze it further to provide customized solutions. ML based chatbot systems are learning from past conversations to generate more thoughtful replies. Roughly 40 of internet users around the globe prefer interacting with chatbots rather than virtual agents. With leading sectors such as retail and healthcare rapidly turning towards digital technology chatbots will continue to grow in popularity in the years to come. According to some reports it is anticipated that the size of the global chatbot market will expand at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of approximately 26 from the years 2022 to 2030. In the year 2021 the chatbot market size was valued at a total of USD 525 million. It is anticipated that the growing adoption of customer service activities among enterprises to reduce operating costs will be the primary factor driving the chatbot market. In the past few years some of the most significant advances that have been made in artificial intelligence and machine learning have been in the areas of perception and cognition. Although there is much room for improvement in voice recognition technology the tech giants like Apple Amazon and Google have all made significant strides in this direction with their digital assistants Siri Alexa and Google Assistant respectively. Deep learning systems are now actively utilized to decide trades accomplished on Wall Street and predict whether users will click on particular advertisements. It has increased efficiency on both the consumer and the business side of things. Chatbots can help businesses save money by generating revenue conducting research generating leads and increasing brand awareness. Other uses for chatbots include research and lead generation. Given the trends of the data we can expect the chatbot industry to surpass the billion dollar mark in a few years. Hence by 2040 the chatbot industry would be having a multi billion dollar market value. Bank of America is responsible for creating one of the most groundbreaking innovations. The recently introduced Erica is intended to assist customers in making more informed choices regarding their finances. Customers can make payments check their balances save money and transfer funds with this chatbot which uses artificial intelligence algorithms and predictive messaging. Erica makes it possible for users to interact via text and voice and it then uses the information provided to push insights to the customer. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines is another company incorporating chatbots into their customer service channel. KLM increased the number of customer interactions with the Facebook messenger app by forty percent. The airline wanted to facilitate more effortless conversations between its employees and passengers without compromising passengers right to personal privacy. KLM was aware that its customers spent a significant amount of time using Facebook and Messenger so the company decided to implement a chatbot as its platform for customer service. Messenger is now the channel through which customers can directly receive booking details boarding passes and flight status updates. On a typical day KLM receives an average of five messages per minute through Facebook Messenger. During peak traffic that number jumps to over eleven messages per minute. These innovations with chatbots will surely pave the way for the future. by 2040 chatbots will completely revolutionize the customer experience domain. There are apparent constraints with AI technology. The absence of emotional intelligence restricts the range and depth of the conversation that can take place when AI driven chatbots are used with customers even though the chatbots can learn from and predict the behavior of the customers. The availability of trained staff and their familiarity with this developing technology is another factor that can hinder the effectiveness of chatbots. Chatbots can have significant limitations when it comes to different languages and accents. This restriction turns into a significant obstacle for companies that operate in more than one location. Maintaining the security of the customer s data is also a key challenge. Even though chatbot technology has some limitations in how it can function there are innumerable advantages of using this technology in improving customer support. The chatbot technology is potent enough to enhance customer support multi folds by 2040. The optimistic thing about this technology is that ML based systems can learn from their own experiences and improve with time. Hence there is a high chance that chatbot technology is perhaps The next big thing in the customer service domain.   \n",
