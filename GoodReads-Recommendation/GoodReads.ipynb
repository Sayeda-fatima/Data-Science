With her single mother's increasing pregnancy and refusal to work, Sadie has to take over her mother's job as a domestic servant for one of the wealthy summer families on a nearby island.When the family arrives at their summer getaway, Sadie is surprised to learn that the owner of the house is Jax Stone, one of the hottest teen rockers in the world. If Sadie hadn't spent her life raising her mother and taking care of the house she might have been normal enough to be excited about working for a rock star.Even though Sadie isn't impressed by Jax's fame, he is drawn to her. Everything about Sadie fascinates Jax but he fights his attraction. Relationships never work in his world and as badly as he wants Sadie, he believes she deserves more. By the end of the summer, Jax discovers he can't breathe without Sadie.\", 'rating': '3.85', 'reviews': 'This book is completely ridiculous. I don\\'t mind some amount of cheesiness, a lot of YA books have some bits, but here I wasn\\'t sure whether to cry or laugh out loud, every page was drooling with lovesick babbling. The characters, the setting, the way they talk, none of that felt REAL for a single second.It was light reading, there weren\\'t any particularly boring passages but it lacked any truth in it. I know that when you read fantasy there is the supernatural element that doesn\\'t make it real as well, but underneath the surface is supposed to be \"some deeper message or thought\" usually slightly pushed away by the romantic plot and whatever. But in contemporary fiction where there is no fantasy background to distract you there should be more focus on the characters and you should take something out of the story. Literature is there to entertain, but also to educate or give you some sort of advice that you can take with you and even apply in a situation you might be in now or one day.Breathewas only telling you a fairytale of a Hollywood teenage film. Sweet Cinderella-ish girl is rewarded for her harsh life by meeting the prince charming, who is there to rescue her.I quite enjoyedThe Vincent Boys, Glines\\'s other book that she wrote after this one, but this one was disappointing.The more I sit on this book and think about it, the more I\\'ve discovered that I really didn\\'t like anything aboutBreatheand that rounding up to 2 stars was my way of being nice and not completely trashing the book. After time, I started to realize that there was nothing about these characters or story which appealed to me (other than Marcus). Maybe it\\'s because I did actually end up enjoying the following book in this seriesBecause of Low(which proves I\\'m not in any sort of anti-Glines camp), I feel less guilty about coming back and down-rating this one after the fact.*Original Review*1.5 stars. I wanted to try this author in another genre to see if my issues were somehow related to the paranormal theme of her Existence trilogy.I think Abbi Glines comes up with great concepts/ideas. She even has promise as a storyteller, if you\\'re looking for light and simple stories. If she could figure out how to write a romance without adding in copious amounts of nickname usage and cringe-worthy terms, I would probably find myself more appreciative of what she\\'s trying to do. Obviously, she\\'s not doing everything wrong, considering this is the second book I\\'ve picked up by her. I\\'ll probably still continue reading the Existence series, even with my laundry list of complaints. There is some part of me that is trying to connect here, yet I couldn\\'t begin to tell you why. I just know that I see promise in this author and keep hoping to see the potential come to fruition. It\\'s as if I\\'m standing on the outside of a very cool house and I\\'m fumbling with a huge ring of keys, hoping to find the right one to fit the door\\'s lock.I sawBreathementioned in another review as a type of Cinderella story and to this, I will agree. The poor, hard-working girl meets her handsome prince, who rescues her from her dull existence. The story was a cute retelling in that aspect. I like rock star stories, so it was a no-brainer that I\\'d want to try outBreathe.If about 10% of the book had been cut (mainly the female\\'s self-bashing and some of her interactions with Marcus, even though I liked Marcus as a character) and a few of the flowery sentiments reigned in, I might have likedBreathe...well, at least a little bit more.This is what knocked the rating down for me :\"You\\'re my...air.\"I frowned at him. \"Your air?\"He grinned. \"Well, girlfriend seems to be too shallow for what I feel for you. These pasttwo weeksit\\'s been as if you control my breathing.\"The lips of the only boy I would ever love touched mine.(How old are you again? Get back to me in 10 years on this.)\"How can taking away the reason my heart beats be good for me?\"I don\\'t think I need to clarify why most of those statements made me feel awkward. Mainly it had to do with the age of the characters, but I\\'d also note that there are ways to show intense love through action and interaction without having to resort to declarations of how someone is your sole reason for existence, which feels sappy and melodramatic. \"I love you\" gets the job done, btw. Or how about, \"hey, life kind of sucks when you\\'re not around. I\\'ve really missed you. Let\\'s try working this out?\"Next up : Self-LoathingFor some reason, this bubbly girl liked me. Me, with no personality.(this was about the fifth mention of the protag\\'s insecurity)One common complaint that you\\'ll see from a lot of YA readers is the frustration over girls who are :1. Plain or lacking personality, yet they seem to have boys fawning all over them.2. Are not plain or lacking personality, yet they seem to constantly harp on the fact that they are, so it\\'s up to the boy (or other characters) to boost their confidence - repeatedly.Either situation gets tiresome to read about. Yes, most teen girls have insecurities. I\\'m pretty sure we all know this by now. It doesn\\'t mean we want to read about it over and over, especially when it\\'s a subject brought up on more than one occasion in a book. Mention it once, then move on.I should probably throw in the towel, but I\\'m going to keep an eye on this author. Am I glutton for punishment? Not necessarily. If her books were that painful to read, I wouldn\\'t keep reading them. The stories are cute, they just happen to have some issues in the execution.I\\'ll admit that I originally picked up this novel because of the cover. No, not the cover it currently has, but the new cover it is going to be receiving. Unfortunately, I find myself regretting my decision to pick up this book and find myself wishing that I was not so easily swayed by my sense of vision. I got a little past the half-way point of this novel before deciding that I simply could not read another sentence of this book. I don\\'t mean to be rude, but this story practically has nothing working for it. The writing is grating, the plot is cliche and overused, the story fails to keep my interest, and the characters are far from \"unique\" and \"different\" as they are said to be.Seventeen-year-old Sadie has had to grow up far more quickly than any other teenager her age. Her father is a married man who vowed to have nothing to do with her after her birth and she has recently moved to Alabama with her mother. Her beautiful mother, however, has fallen in love with the wrong managainand has gotten herself pregnant. Now, Sadie finds herself taking her mother\\'s job working for the famous teen rock-star Jax Stone. Although Sadie keeps her distance from Jax, their attraction cannot be denied. Jax, who is unable to stay away from the beautiful blonde, eventually succumbs to his desire. Yet, things are not always as easy as they should be and sometimes, you need to take the hard path to keep your love.My issues with this novel start from the very first chapter. I don\\'t know if this is Glines first novel, but her writing grated on me far too much for comfort. First and foremost, she failed to employ the show-not-tell method. Instead she used the tell-not-show method which I loathe. I was constantly being barreled with people telling Sadie howdifferentshe was, howunique.Every now and then someone would tell Sadie howbeautifulshe was and she\\'d act completely surprised and tell them that she was justaverageand didn\\'t have any personality to which they\\'d reply that she had awonderfulpersonality. Perhaps I could have dealt with this if it happened once, or maybe even twice, but this dialogue just became far too redundant for my liking. Plus, Sadie fails to live up to the adjectives she is known for. Although she tries to stay away from Jax Stone, she ends up being just like every other girl (or rather every other YA female protagonist) andfalls in lovewith him by Chapter 6! Furthermore, all the qualities that supposedly made her unique, really didn\\'t. I know at least fifty girls, myself included, who share the same traits as Sadie yet I haven\\'t had people come up and tell me that I\\'m sodifferentandspecial!This, of course, leads me to the conclusion that the only reason Sadie gets the attention she gets is because of her gorgeous features that she denies having. At one point she refers to her legs as \"skinny sticks\" yet all the guys claim that she has the \"best\" and \"most curvaceous\" legs in town. I get that Sadie is modest and naive, but there is a certain degree to humility. With Sadie, it just felt as if she was fishing for compliments and I wanted to smack her for coming off as vain and conceited when I was constantly being told by all the characters that shewasn\\'t.I\\'ll make that decision for myself thankyouverymuch. =PSadie wasn\\'t the only character I had a problem with though. Jax Stone, teenage rock-star extraordinaire, was equally, if not more, irritating than Sadie was. The first, and only, time that Jax and Sadie meet before Sadie falls in \"love\" (actually lust) with him, Jax is kind to a nine-year-old girl who just lost her father in war. Sadie, like any normal human-being, is moved by this. However, Jax is surprised because he\\'s never known that a girl might like him for his kindness towards young girls. Um, excuse me? I can count on one finger the number of women who arenotattracted to kind men! (In case you were wondering, the one finger was for Bellatrix Lestrange). To have Jax, who is constantly being fawned over by girls around the country, tell Sadie that he didn\\'t know this was just a tad bit too unrealistic. Plus, he tells Sadie that her finding him attractive because of his kindness makes herunique!See where I\\'m coming from? It isn\\'t true, it doesn\\'t make her unique, and it makes you a stupid dolt for (a) saying that and (b) not knowing it\\'s true! Plus, Jax\\'s entire relationship with Sadie was based off of one thing: appearance. Jax looks at Sadie, Sadie is beautiful, Jax wants Sadie, Jax always gets what he wants, Jax tells Sadie she smells nice, Jax tells Sadie she has pretty hair, Jax enjoys kissing Sadie, Jax wants to flaunt Sadie off so other guys will know she\\'s taken,Jax is being a possessive a-hole!Seriously, I hate relationships where a guy is possessive and clingy. I\\'m not saying it\\'s not nice to have a guy who gets jealous sometimes or who wants to be seen with you, but Jax was taking it to an extreme. Furthermore, no one seemed to call him out on it! Jax\\'s housekeeper even tells Sadie that she should have called him the one time she happened to be late for work because she was with her pregnant mother in the hospital! Uhh...what? Jax and Sadie weren\\'t even officially dating at this point, she didn\\'t have his number,andhe was out of town when she left for the hospital. But, no matter, just call Jax because he needs to know where you are 24/7. Christian Grey much? =.=Honestly, this book was boring, dull, and just plain irritating. Unless you like possessive relationships, insta-love stories, cheesy romances, and lots of useless dialogue that doesn\\'tactuallyexplain a character\\'s personality, I would not recommend this to you. I think the best part of this novel is having finished it, or at least part of it. Now, I canactuallybreathe (with relief from not having to read it anymore)! ;)Clear case of Mary Sue-ism and taking the templates of Twilight\\'s Bella and Edward into the world of \"rock \\'n roll\".BellaSadie was gorgeous but felt she was dull and not worth anyone\\'s notice, and she was the grown up, her mother was hopeless about paying bills and remembering to use condoms. She also had less personality than a stale Ritz cracker that you find covered in dust bunnies and cat fur under the couch during spring cleaning, and about as much appeal (to me at least). Her speech was wooden and completely unbelievable. The girl didn\\'t even use contracted words for the first half of the book for fuck\\'s sake.EdwardJax was perfect in every way but tortured over his inability to shield his lady love from the bad things in his life. Everyone thinks he\\'s untouchable but all it takes is one quiet girl to capture his attention and WHAM! he\\'s fallen into insta-love with her. Because she sees therealhim. Naturally. And he proceeds to claim to have her best interested at heart (while he spends the first two weeks stalking her from his bedroom window), then making a public display of their relationship and acting all surprised when shit hits the fan. There\\'s even a near-catatonic shut down when he breaks up with her where she doesn\\'t eat or drink or sleep for days untilJakeMarcus, aka the guy-friend-who-is-also-in-love-with-Sadie-and-repeatedly-tells-her-that-her-boyfriend-is-not-good-for-her, comes to her rescue and pulls her out of her misery. And let\\'s not leave out the hospital stay whereEdwardJax has to bringBellaSadie out of her coma by promising to stay with her forever.If you\\'re looking for barely disguised schmoopy Twilight fanfic without the paranormal element, you\\'ll adore this. If you\\'re looking for a well-written teen romance peopled with characters who have more than two dimensions and are capable of rubbing a couple of brain cells together, I suggest skipping this.Seventeen year-old Sadie White just moved from Tennessee to the Alabama coast with her mother. Her mother, who she refers to as Jessica, is very pregnant by a loser-du-jour boyfriend. Sadie\\'s mom refuses to work anymore, so Sadie has no choice but to try and take over her mother\\'s job as a domestic servant in a swanky mansion. Little does Sadie know that this is the home of the very famous, drool-worthy, Jax Stone, the teen-heart-throb singer. Normally, they wouldn\\'t hire a teenage girl to work for fear that she was some star-struck stalker, but Sadie proves herself and is hired on. Sure, she knows who Jax Stone is, but she\\'s got bigger things to worry about than swooning over some spoiled teen rock-star. Sadie doesn\\'t want to lose her job and the only source of income she has, so she stays completely neutral around Jax. When she\\'s first around him, Sadie barely makes eye contact. This is a little hard to do when Jax openly stares at her. You see, Sadie has inherited her mother\\'s stunning looks, a fact she is completely unaware of. Jax is immediately drawn to Sadie, she\\'s so mature for her age and isn\\'t affected by his persona. But Jax is only there for the summer and he knows what his lifestyle does to people. So Jax tries to stay away from Sadie and fails miserably. This is especially hard when Jax sees Marcus, one of the servers, taking Sadie under his wing and getting close.I adored this story. I just was gaga over Jax! He ended up being such a sweet-heart, sweeping Sadie off her feet. She couldn\\'t help but fall for him. Jax was never judgmental over Sadie\\'s mom. He tried to make Sadie comfortable and not insult her situation in life. Sadie was such a good and kind girl with a big heart. I can\\'t believe all the things she put up with her mother. Ireally wishedSadie would\\'ve called her mom out on her behavior! She was a self-centered, horrible woman! I can\\'t imagine a mother having her daughter buy her condoms, remind her to use them, and still manage to screw up. I could go on, and on, and on! I literally wanted to smack this mother!I really liked all the secondary characters. First and foremost, Marcus, the college-student hottie, working there over the summer, you can\\'t help but feel bad for him. Then there\\'s Ms. Mary, the head of the house staff. She is like the mother Sadie never had, so kind and loving (I teared up a little at the end because of her) and Mr. Greg the elderly gardener.The last 20% of this story was a little bit of a roller coaster. I wanted to throttle someone one minute and then I was swooning the next. For the most part, this was an all-around feel good book. Maybe a little on the predictable side, but it leaves you with a smile on your face. I highly recommend readingBecause of Lowright after this. It\\'s a sequel to Breathe. It centers mainly on Marcus, but Jax and Sadie are in there too. Don\\'t pass it up, it\\'s all kinds of HOT!!'}, {'title': 'Rock Chick #1Rock Chick', 'author': 'Kristen Ashley', 'summary': \"An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.Indy Savage, cop's daughter, rock chick and used bookstore owner, has been in love with Lee Nightingale, once bad boy, now the man behind Nightingale Investigations, since she was five years old.

I really tried to love this book. Then I tried to like this book. Then I just tried to finish this book. Unfortunately, Indy, the heroine, ruined the story for me.I\\'m honestly at a loss trying to express my sheer annoyance, disapointment, and frankly, total embarrassment with Indy\\'s character. Not only was she flat out nuts, had one too many TSTL (to stupid to live) moments, and was beyond wishy washy; but, she was also the stupidest heroine I\\'ve read to date. I mean, the girl needed a basic refresher course in 6th grade sexual education for heaven sakes!The only good that came from this book, in my opinion, was the amazing and sexy hero, Lee Nightingale. I loved his charcter and name! Other than that, I did not enjoy this story. I hope I\\'ll have better luck with the rest of the series.If you\\'re already a Kristen Ashley addict, or interested in checking out her books, be sure to stop by ourKristen Ashley Addict\\'s Support Grouphere on Goodreads!This was my firstKristen Ashleyexperience, and I am officiallyconfused.Let me explain.1)You are finally together with the man you\\'ve been in love with your entire life. Do you flirt with his colleagues and friends in front of him?a) Hell to the no, why would I do that?b) Hell yeah, momma likes some action!c) N/A2)You\\'ve been shot at and kidnapped. Your badass boyfriend (who has ties with the policeandthe mob) asks you to let him handle the situation and refrain from doing something stupid because the guys you\\'re dealing with are super dangerous (and creepy). You:a) Do as he told because you don\\'t want to die youngb) Do the exact opposite, attack assassins and get kidnapped again while you pretend to be a ninja because no man will tell you what to do (but at the same time when things get serious, you wait impatiently for him to come rescue you and clean up your mess)c) N/AIf you answered at least one a) like me, thenIndy willannoythe crap out of you!“My life had been simple a day ago. Work, coffee, rock \\'n\\' roll. Now I was being shot at, dragged around by bad guys and propositioned by the love of my life who I had decided I didn\\'t want anymore.”That\\'s what happens inRock Chick!Stolen diamonds, hitmen, icky and slightly insane crime lordsand Indy in the middle, because she was at the wrong place the wrong time. But this unfortunate situation brings her closer to Lee, the man she\\'s been in love with since she was 5 years old and rejected her repeatedly, who has made up his mind and wants to be with her at all costs. And is also involved in this bizarre diamonds hunt. Indy tries to resist Lee\\'s charms and solve the case on her own, because she is a Rock Chick and doesn\\'t like staying behind. Even if that means discovering dead bodies, being kidnappedthreetimes and endangering everyone near her.“I haven’t been avoiding you.”“You’re lying. The last time we were both at dinner, you got up in the middle of Mom’s fajita presentation and said you forgot to feed your cat.”“So?”“You don’t have a cat.”I really liked this book, I can\\'t deny that! It wasfunny, with agenerous dose of action and sexual tension, and I would rate it higher if it wasn\\'t thislongand if Indy stopped acting like a 6 years old. Yes she was cool and strong-minded but man! there were times I wanted to throttle her! She argued for the sake of arguing and had the weird belief that being a Rock Chick means never listen to the voice of reason because this voice belongs to a man, ahunk-a-licousman I may say, who wants to protect you because you\\'rebatshit crazy! I listen to metal and enjoy a decent headbanging once in a while but I don\\'t stun gun people in bar fights and I don\\'t play detective when I\\'m not even sure what\\'s at stake (besides my life, of course!).Setting aside Indy\\'s shenanigans, I did enjoy the story! There were plenty of interesting and hilarious characters, and Lee had me drooling becauseholy.hawt.alpha.male.alert! He wascockyandbadassand very,veryyummy! And patient, anyone else would run away from Indy faster than Road Runner! Their scenes were loaded withsizzling tension, and I loved the fact that they had history together and knew each other so well. I would not mind spending the rest of my days in Lee\\'s cabin, just saying!“I don’t get a taste of you soon, I’m givin’ up the search and takin’ you to my cabin in Grand Lake. No phones, no cell coverage, no buzzer. Anyone knocks on the door and I’m shooting them.”Overall, I think I\\'ll giveKristen Ashleyanother shot, but only if I get some guarantee that I will not want to murder her female characters!Pure. Freaking.Gold.LOVE LOVE LOVED this hilarious, romantic, action-packed book!!This is probably the most all-out FUN book I\\'ve ever read! I mean, how can you not love a book about a smart, independent, sassy heroine and her Badass Extraordinaire hero getting together? huh? Its impossible not to I tell you. Impossible! :)I cannot possibly gush enough. This book was BRILLIANT!! It had me flipping pages like mad, grinning endlessly and laughing and squeeing out-loud more times than I could count!Its insanely well-written. Kristen Ashley has an absolute gift with words. Her writing style is so effortless, you feel like you are right in the head of the main character.The book is never boring, there is no stupidity from the characters, and the drama in the background compliments the character development of the story rather than complicates it. Its a delicate balance that Ms. Ashley has really perfected!The story is about India \"Indy\" Savage and Liam \"Lee\" Nightingale. Indy\\'s been in love with Lee since she was five. For reasons\\' you\\'ll learn about, he couldn\\'t admit he felt the same way until very recently. But they basically grew up together, then Lee went off to join the Army/Special Ops and went from badboy to Badass Extraordinaire and now runs his own detective agency. Fast track to present day, Indy\\'s friend gets involved in some very shady business involving some illegally grown plants and million dollar diamonds, resulting in people shooting at them with guns and end up being helped out of the predicament by Lee... who of course uses this as the perfect stepping stone to finally get together with Indy.\"What was he playing at?He told me.And he told me bluntly.“I do this thing for Rosie, you sleep with me\"I stared at him, open-mouthed and in stunned silence.I did, of course, understand what he meant but he explained further.\"Not like last night, we\\'ll both be naked and sexual acts will be performed.\"My expression didn\\'t change except maybe my mouth opened wider.\"I\\'ll expect your participation.\"Holy shit.\"Your avid participation.\"Dear Lord in Heaven.Eventually, I whispered, \"You must be joking.\"He shook his head and watched me.I dropped my eyes, unable to hold his stare.\"I think I need more coffee,\"\"Oooooo Lee. Liam freaking Nightingale. I love you. There I said it. He\\'s a wonderful hero - all delicious badass, uberly possessive, don\\'t-fuck-with-me-or-my-woman, Alpha male.

He\\'s the definition of fine.\"\"I\\'ve been in love with him since I was five,\" I told Tod.\"I\\'m in love with him now. I want to have his children, Tod told me.\"I loved that he doesn\\'t play games, is open and honest about his feelings and thoughts even to the point of being cocky but never hides anything. What you see is what you get. Oh, and did I mention he\\'s totally hot?\"Jesus,\" he buried his face in my neck. \"There\\'s nothin\\' better in the world than hearing you say my name when I\\'m inside you.\" He slid in deeper, filling me. \"I\\'ve been waiting years to be right here.\"And Indy was feisty, fun-loving, sassy, takes-no-orders-and-won\\'t-back-down-from-anything, funny, not at all annoying and totally lovable!And I loved that they had known each other their whole lives instead of just meeting and hooking up. Its gave a familiarity to the characters - and made their fast relationship much more believable.\"I like that we have history and our kids will have a big family and share that history because there was never a time when their Mom and Dad weren\\'t together.\"~LeeThis book is full of typical KA fun - there are kidnappings galore, car chases, steamy bedroom scenes, swoony moments, outright hilarious moments, drag queen performances, shoot-outs, explosions, a seriously epic food-fight, and of course, a wonderful love story. Also, we get introduced to a bunch of wonderful side-characters who will be heavily featured in the rest of the series :)I absolutely ADORED this book!! and I recommend it to everybody and anybody! Run and get this book - you won\\'t regret it!!Here\\'s how I see Lee and Indy:For more of my reviews, visitAestas Book BlogAnd come join the Aestas Book BlogFacebook PageControlling asshole + TSTL heroine + plot nonsense + stereotypes everywhere =I\\'m calling bullshit.For real,this book takes the crappy romance at a whole new level- I could be almost bewildered if I wasn\\'t so pissed.You know what?I read the full book and I don\\'t get it. I might write a full review when I calm down. Someday. In the meantime, I must introduce some facts to provide further information to explain my rating, because I do realize that I\\'m in a huge minority here.Before I start, what you need to know is the fact that Indy knows Lee from her childhood and loved him almost always since, except for the 10 previous years. Why is it important? Why, becauseit\\'s used as the perfect excuse to explain thatthere isn\\'t ANY character development and/or relationship growth.➊Controlling asshole: Okay OKAY I get it, I get it. Here\\'s a handsome wild man, a tad mysterious, drop-dead sexy, who Indy loves since she\\'s 5, who carries a gun and is protective, who\\'s...WHATEVER. I don\\'t care about all these wonderful qualities, because :1)He isrepeatedly violentin his moves: he pushes her, catches her wrist,\"hook [her] around the back of the neck with enough force to send [her] slamming into him\". Wow, how romantic.2)He wants tocontrol every one of her actions, starting with their relationship :\"This is happening between you and me,\" hethreatened.\"Indeed Indy repeats several times that she is SCARED by him and his controlling behavior. What bothered me the most is the fact that the TSTL behavior of the heroine is used as an EXCUSE to explain Lee\\'s reactions and to make the reader believe that it\\'s okay.Nope. It\\'s not okay to handcuff your girlfriend at the bed because you don\\'t want her to go out. And it\\'s certainly not okay to FORBID your girlfriend to wear what she wants to wear. Oh, but don\\'t worry, Lee has an asshole as a friend who agrees with him.\"For what it\\'s worth, I\\'m with Lee. If you were my woman, there\\'s no fuckin\\' way I\\'d let you out of the house wearin\\' that.\"YOU DON\\'T SAY?!3)He is ajealous prick. Now, a little jealousy can be great, but come on. Lee overreacts completely when Indytalksto another guy.➋TSTL heroine: basically, Indy is the stupid chick in scary movie. Yeah, you got it, the one we can\\'t help but yell at toSTAY IN THE FUCKING HOUSE!To sum up, she is kidnapped3 times, goes outevery timesomeone tells her to stay hidden despite the really bad guys who constantly shot at her, decides to investigate while she obviously shouldn\\'t (plus, she gives her real name to every dubious person she meets : who does that??). I know some readers found her kick-ass. I\\'m sorry but this girl? She isn\\'t badass. No. When I think of her, here\\'s how I picture Indy :What? She acts like she\\'s 6 while she\\'s 30.Moreover, although in her inner monologues she complains about Lee\\'s controlling behavior,she always gave in. EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.PS: I almost forgot to say that she is so fucking SPECIAL that she has 3 guys fighting for her. Yep. 3.➌Plot nonsenseYou know what?I\\'m done.For more of my reviews, please visit:So, I’ve decided to bring this book with me to Thanksgiving dinner.Why, you ask?Well, that’s a silly question.I mean, I have to havesomethingto show good ol’ Aunt Deb when I tell her that my future husband is Lee Nightingale.Duh.Otherwise everyone will just think I’m crazy.Which is ridiculous.Clearly.But enough about Lee. I’ll get to him later…*eyebrow waggle*I want to talk to ya guys about Kristen Ashley. This is the first novel of her that I’ve read (we’ll celebrate later)… and it’s crazy because right away, her writing FLOORED me! She has such a signature writing style that I love! It’s witty; it’s snarky; it’s sexy. And she’s just so comfy with it, know what I mean? This is an author who completelyownswhat she does.AND I LOVE THAT!So onto the story…Rock Chickin a nutshell, is about a kickass girl, Indy Savage.Indy owns a bookstore, and her brilliant coffee-maker-guy gets into trouble. Because well, he’s a pot (as in marijuana) seller. Andhemakes the mistake of selling to the wrong guy, who instead of paying coffee-maker-guy in cash, pays him indiamonds. That didn’t even belong to him in the first place.Follow?So because they don’t belong to him, coffee-maker-guy is now stuck with stolen diamonds. And one morning he shows up to work, at Indy’s bookstore, and they both get shot at… because they have stolen diamonds.Now, Indy is the daughter of a cop. So she has plenty of people to call for help on this. But she knows there’s only reallyoneman who can get the job done.*BIG eyebrow waggle*That’s right… she calls none other than THE Lee Nightingale.And the reason why I call himtheLee Nightingale is because that’s exactly how Indy thinks of him, as well. See, Indy has been in love with Lee since she was five. They grew up together. But he’s always been off limits.Plus, he’s kind of scary.As in jenny-get-your-gun scary.So she calls him. And he, of course, helps her out. But he’s not just doing it be a good ol’ Samaritan. No no no… he’s doing it because he expects sexual favors in return. Which baffles the cruddola out of Indy, because well… Lee has always told her that he always saw her as the “little sister” type.So now Indy’s getting shot at all of a suddenandthe love of her life who she’s finally gotten over suddenly decides he wants her.Aaaand…. I can’t tell you anymore because I’ll give everything away. ;)So about the characters…I loved every character in this book.Every. Single. One.I loved the stoner “Kevster” (his vocabulary is ha-ha-larious).I loved Indy’s drag-queen neighbor.Andlaaaaaawd, did I freaking LOVE cat-sitter Tex! (“Holy fuck, pandemonium at the gay bar!” <-------- Best. Line. Ever.)What was so awesome about the characters is that they’re all so eclecticallyeccentric. But they go together so well! Bravo, Kristen Ashley… bra-freakin-vo.So about my review…My review is this: this is book fantastic, and if you haven’t read it yet… Ireallydon’t know what you’re doing sitting there reading this review. This book’s got everything: guns, car chases, hysterical one-liners, a kickass heroine, and one SEXY AS HELL alpha male <----- Just remember he’s mine, okay? ;)So…***GO! GO! GO!***ReadRock Chick, and let me know what you think!P.S.To those whohaveread it… HUGE HIGH FIVE!'}, {'title': 'FBI/US Attorney #2A Lot like Love', 'author': 'Julie James', 'summary': 'ISBN: 9780425240168 updated version found hereThe FBI wants her cooperation...As the daughter of a billionaire and the owner of the city\\'s top wine store, Jordan Rhodes is invited to the most exclusive parties in Chicago.

The H\\'s conversion from lifelong commitment-phobe dedicated to his profession to a man dropping the L word and taking an office job seemed to happen overnight and with very little character explanation. They just didn\\'t seem to spend allthatmuch time together to predicate such a changeover, in my opinion.But whatever.If you are in the mood for a light, entertaining romance, this one will do you right.

Sexy, yes!!Alpha, yes!! But not an overbearing ass.@@@@....I adored him.....open minded, caring......he\\'s the kind of man I love..........Heiress and Businesswoman Jordan Rhodes....what a breath of fresh air she turned out to be. Not some neurotic and spoilt heiress but a funny, independent, hardworking, caring and down to earth person...she felt so real and I found her endearing and so engaging - and how could one not fall in love with her...I liked seeing their relationship and sexual tension building up and the chemistry was potent....and the sex scenes were pretty hot and well written.The dialogue is fun and witty.....“He raised an eyebrow. ‘Wine with cheese fries? No thanks.’‘Wine with everything. Because wine means the responsible part of the day is over.’”Some quirky and engaging secondary characters.....I especially loved Jordan\\'s brother, Kyle.......what a hoot!!! Can\\'t wait to read his own book!!The writing is so good....flows beautifully making it such easy reading.Fun plot....emphasis on romance more than suspense. Loved reading the parts about wine and the vineyards that Jordan and Nick visit in Napa Valley.....hell, I admit, I learnt a few things about wine!!!!“Time for Wine Tasting 101.“So here’s how this works. When tasting a wine, as opposed to casual drinking, there are four basic steps you need to remember: sight, smell, taste, then spit or swallow.”Nick paused at that last part and cocked his head. “And your personal preference on the latter would be…?”“Only lightweights spit.”His right eye twitched.”If you love contemporary romance that makes you \"feel good\"...then this is a book for you.

In order to infiltrate an exclusive charity event held by one of Chicago’s wealthiest restaurateur’s at an elite wine club, the FBI needs the cooperation of billionaire heiress and wine entrepreneur Jordan Rhodes.Jordan will do anything to help her incarcerated brother get early parole, even if it means aiding an arrogant, gruff, and rough around the edges agent known for his “don’t-fuck-with-me” look who pushes all her buttons, both good and bad, like Nick McCall. Nick grew up in Brooklyn and would rather take on dangerous criminals and kick back with a nice glass of bourbon after a hard day than attend fancy wine tastings with stuffy, high society types, and polished rich women like Jordan aren’t his type. But opposites definitely attract, and when Nick and Jordan are forced to spend more time together masquerading as a couple, fighting their combustible chemistry and drawing the line between lies and love becomes impossible.It’s a flawless, vastly entertaining contemporary romance with a hot alpha hero, a smart and sassy heroine, great secondary characters, clever dialogue, refreshing and witty banter, laugh out loud humor, and steamy love scenes. And who knew that wine could be so damn sexy?!The part when Jordan demonstrated to Nick how to properly sample wine and the scene when Nick made creative, sensual use of a glass of cabernet during a shared bubble bath were smokin’ hot!I absolutelylovedA Lot Like Loveand highly recommend it for contemporary romance fans! 5 stars!Here’s my favorite quote:“You came into my life and messed the whole thing up and now I’m screwed.

I loved the story, and it distracted me from the misery of having a seat back rammed against my knees for three hours. You know the book has got to be good.A LOT LIKE LOVE tells the story of Jordan Rhodes, heiress to half of a billion-dollar fortune, and Nick McCall, FBI agent. Rhodes isn\\'t a prissy heiress whose biggest worries are ruining her manicure or being seen with the right people; she\\'s a solid person who\\'s down to earth and who has worked to build her own successes in life. She owns an upscale wine store — can they actually serve wine in a wine store in Illinois? They can\\'t in Colorado —\\xa0and is an expert on fermented grape. Her social circle includes someone the FBI would like to know more about.Nick McCall makes Jordan an offer she can\\'t refuse to win her cooperation in helping him establish covert surveillance — i.e., bug —\\xa0of this person of interest. And thus Jordan and McCall are forced to deal with one another. They trade sarcasm and quips — a kind of banter at which Julie James excels —\\xa0and slowly fall into lust and then love with one another.So, I have to ask myself whether deep in her heart, the attorney side of Ms. James has a hankering for suspense. James writes contemporary romance, but both books I\\'ve read would satisfy fans of romantic suspense, as well.This is the first non-attorney heroine that James has written, and I have to give her props for doing that. It would be like me writing romantic suspense novel without a journalist heroine, something I haven\\'t been brave enough to do yet. I think she does a splendid job of it, clearly having done her research into wine. I found myself wanting to write down tips, which I KNOW other readers have done, as the most frequent highlights in the Kindle version involved the various steps of wine tasting. So James is helping to launch a new cadre of oinophiles, which is all to the good.Romantic fiction and wine go well together — almost as well as romance and wine.I found myself giggling out loud at some points, which no one heard because planes are so noisy. I felt the characters were believable and endearing, including secondary characters, and I enjoyed seeing Cameron and Jack again. I got a real kick out of Nick\\'s relationship with his long-suffering mother.Also, I found the sex scenes very hot and fun to read. That\\'s important.And I\\'m just so grateful to James for writing this book because otherwise I probably would have gotten thrown off my flight by TSA for yelling at the person in front of me. I need to go back now and read her first two titles.This is my first Julie James book and I have to admit, I have a soft spot for police/FBI/military romance, because all the heroes are soooo bad ass and you just can’t stop falling for them.“A Lot Like Love” is a very cute, light story between Nick McCall, an FBI agent and Jordan Rhodes, a very smart, gorgeous woman from the wine industry. The blurb was very interesting and I began immediately with this love story, believing it will be action packed, because, duuuh, FBI and stuf..It was not as predicted, but I liked it.. It was funny and had a lot of steamy moments, with a great chemistry between the characters.To make a summary, Nick is an FBI agent, specialized in undercover operations. When he is offered the chance to take down a money launderer, he takes it without blinking. All his life he was the best in the field, always delivering excelent results and making his superiors proud. Only that there is one bad side to this >> no personal life. He doesn’t do relationships because of the complexity of his work, being constantly on the field and having no time for love. Nick needs help from Jordan to infiltrate him in the world of the notorious money launderer and in exchange, he will help her brother which is imprisoned get a milder sentence. Jordan was amazing as a heroine, I loved her sassy ways and her confidence.She has an excelent wine business and her passion for his industry made her well known at the top of the chain. She is also the heiress of an empire, but this didn’t stop her for gaining everything on her own. When Nick makes her that proposal, she agrees to help in order to save her brother. Their mission will be to attend a wine party organized by their target and manage to give Nick time to bug the place to gain info. Of course complications will arise and the two of them will have a lot of time to spend together, that will gradually became something bigger and more powerful.They were very funny together, with a lot of good dialogues, that manage to catch the essence of this couple. They are very much alike, stubborn and passionate about their jobs, but also kind of proud and would never give in first in an argument. Why only 3.5 stars? I wanted something else… Beginning with the characters and ending with the plot. Their relationship should have been more explored and I wanted to see them in various circumstances.. It felt kind of short and shallow in some parts of the book. And as for the plot, it was very researched and well written, but predictable. I liked Julie’s research in wine that were passed on to Jordan, but the action parts were slow and didn’t go far beyond average…So, an easy and cozy read, which takes like 2 days to read. If you want something cute and uncomplicated, this is surely for you:)For more reviews please checkhttps://readwithloveblog.wordpress.com'}, {'title': \"Winter's Orbit #1Winter’s Orbit\", 'author': 'Everina Maxwell', 'summary': \"Ancillary Justice meets Red, White & Royal Blue in Everina Maxwell's exciting debut.While the Iskat Empire has long dominated the system through treaties and political alliances, several planets, including Thea, have begun to chafe under Iskat's rule. When tragedy befalls Imperial Prince Taam, his Thean widower, Jainan, is rushed into an arranged marriage with Taam's cousin, the disreputable Kiem, in a bid to keep the rising hostilities between the two worlds under control.But when it comes to light that Prince Taam's death may not have been an accident, and that Jainan himself may be a suspect, the unlikely pair must overcome their misgivings and learn to trust one another as they navigate the perils of the Iskat court, try to solve a murder, and prevent an interplanetary war... all while dealing with their growing feelings for each other.\", 'rating': '3.99', 'reviews': \"If the high concept of “a wayward, scandal-magnet prince and a serious, duty-bound scholar are drafted into a political marriage and forced to work together in order to prevent an interplanetary war” appeals to you, this book is probably for you.That summary, however, does not do the story complete justice.Winter’s Orbitrepresents what I like best about the genre:☑ an extraordinarily imaginative world with varied forces forming a tremulous web of fraught coexistence☑ complicated political machinations☑ that racy adventurous feel of a mystery left unsolved☑ deftly rendered characters that drive straight to your heart☑ an ineffably tender romance with high stakesAll of it woven through a superbly assured prose to create the kind of storytelling that wells up to pull you into a thrilling reading experience.Winter’s Orbitalso has several rewarding emotional layers. To talk about them, I'll have to spoil a few things about the story. So, spoilers ahead!***Jainan’s chapters are absolutelypainfulto read. From the outset, Jainan carries himself with the flinching weariness of a man with memories that require iron cages, kept still and captive so they do not devour him whole. This comes with a sense of foreboding, a whisper of wrongness. We do not immediately understand why Jainan moves so timidly through the narrative, always guarded, always careful, like he is waiting for a blow. Why he often has to realign his whole world around a single act of kindness. Why everything he thinks and does tends towards an all-pervasive self-loathing. Most chilling is the sense that Jainan’s private, repeated mantras carry the echo of someone else’s voice. The full picture soon begins to bloom like a stain across the paper: the full arc of Jainan’s traumatic relationship with his abusive ex-husband, who, for five years, used his position as an imperial prince to etch the knowledge of powerlessness directly into Jainan’s mind, cutting all Jainan’s tethers—his family, his friends, his dreams—and making sure Jainan had no ally but his abuser, which is to say, that he had no ally at all.Through Jainan’s character, the novel plumbs the cavernous depths of domestic abuse, tracing the interwoven strands of shame, anger, guilt, and sometimes even grief, that cling to survivors after they’re freed from their abusers. It’s a devastating topic, but the author handles it with so much care. Abuse, the novel hauntingly illustrates, carves a wound so deep and so hidden it takes a very long time to find it and address it. It casts a vast, horrible shadow over your relationships and leaves you unmoored. There are so few literary accounts of domestic abuse in queer relationships (something I read a while ago about it still haunts me: “when your love is taboo, so are its violences.”) so stories likeWinter’s Orbitare crucial in expanding the scope of the queer experience.Prince Kiem offers a really good counterpart to Jainan's character. Prince Kiem has carefully constructed his reputation as the evanescently charming, scandal-prone prince who leads an unfettered life, the way one might erect a brick façade or drape armor around their body. One of the novel’s most rewarding moments is seeing Kiem with his defenses lowered, his shields abandoned on the ground, all the barricades abraded. Behind the charming façade is someone who is insecure and self-effacing, so tragically concerned with other people’s unfavorable opinions of him, so lonely and so desperate not to be. Someone who can also be naive sometimes: by his own admission, Prince Kiem did not care for the intricacies of war and politics and did his best to banish from his thoughts all of the Empire and its tumultuous affairs. Slowly lifting the fog of complacency and ignorance around Kiem, the novel forces him to confront several uncomfortable truths, and when it does, Kiem throws himself headlong into unearthing the secrets lodged under the Empire’s skin, holding them into the light and calling for wrongs to be set aright. All of it in a beautiful display of character-development.Obviously, Jainan and Kiem cannot be any more different. Where Kiem is loud and chaotic and draws all eyes like a flare, Jainan is a world unto himself, with a shadow’s talent for passing unremarked. For long stretches of the novel, both Jainan and Kiem keep an invisible barbed wire between them. I loved how Kiem fell in love with Jainan in one swift motion, clear and unmistakable, and how slowly he eased open Jainan’s heart like a book, mindful of the places, still tender and aching, where the past left its bruises. I loved how Jainan stood firmly by Kiem’s side, slowly learning to let go and trust that Kiem’s embrace will break his fall. This novel isabout the yearning, honey. The will-they-won’t-they back and forth drove me to the brink of INSANITY, and I wanted to scream at both of them to “PLEASE JUST KISS”.All in all,Winter’s Orbitis a smart, tender, and deeply rewarding gem of space opera. I could have gladly spent twice as long with Jainan and Kiem, and still longed for more by the end.i feel a little duped. i saw quite a few reviews firmly stating this is a romance with a sci-fi setting, but i actually have to strongly disagree. this is very much a sci-fi story with a very small side of romance.the romance is used more as a minor plot devise rather than the actual plot. add to that the slowburn nature of it all and it becomes practically non-existent. this isnt a bad thing, but i picked this up with the intention of reading a romance story and this was not it.setting my personal disappoint aside, i do recognise this is a good book, especially as a debut novel. its well-written, the pacing is consistent, and the plot feels well thought-out for a standalone. i did, however, skim through a lot of the parts about the military, mining operations, and interplanetary diplomatic relations as it was very dull content for me. but again, this goes back to me wanting the focus to be on the romance instead.so i have no problem saying that readers looking for an interesting sci-fi novel about an allegeded murder cover-up and political scheming will enjoy this. but if you are wanting a sci-fi romance, i would suggest reading something else.↠3.5 starsOnce again Tor shows up for the gaysThere's been some discussion within the SFF community recently about books with romance as thecentralfocus and the SFF aspect as abackdrop, rather than the other way around. I'm mentioning this because WINTER'S ORBIT is exactly the kind of work that slots itself neatly (in my mind) as asci-fi romancerather than sci-fiwithromance. And so is exactly the kind of romance-focused SFF work people (including myself) are interested in seeing pop up more.It's been pitched as many things:Ancillary JusticemeetsGideon the Ninth, orAncillary JusticemeetsRed, White & Royal Blue. Personally, I'd pitch to fans ofMDZS/The Untamed- it's got the same bubby x stoic dynamic (Kiem really reminded me of WWX), useless gays and a slowburn romance born out of misunderstanding.Anyway, it is first and foremost a romance and secondly a book about a murder and galactic politics. It was fun and charming, with worldbuilding on the lighter side. And true to its roots as an online novel, the heroes are faced with convenient problems and a fair smattering of tropes. (Example: in the middle of the book, these two useless individuals - in a marriage of convenience and both mistakenly thinking the other doesn't like them - have crashed in the middle of nowhere. Dramatics ensue, including the love interest (sexily) fighting off a bear to save the hero. Then they have to huddle together for warmth in their tiny tent in what is essentially the 'there's only one bed' trope.)It wasn't perfect - there were bits where I thought it meandered just a bittoomuch and I felt my attention slipping, and I wished I could'velovedJainan (the love interest) rather than just liking him. It also didn't make my heart flutter as much I wish it could have done. But it was fun, and I've already recommended it to others.If you're a reader who wants detailed worldbuilding and a narrative that adheres strictly to the plot rather than meandering for personal & romantic character developments, WINTER'S ORBIT may not be the perfect read for you. But if you like your romanceandyour science fiction, then hurrah.> 4 stars+ content warning for domestic abuse (in a relationship prior to the story's start, mainly alluded to but seen clearly in flashbacks near the end of the novel)Thank you to Orbit UK for the proof copy!*as a useless gay myself, I am very interested in a book full of similarly useless gaysSci-fi romance, heavier on the romance, with a lot of pining and hurt/comfort. I wasn't surprised to see this originated on AO3: there's a very distinctive quality in the setup, structure and pacing. Someone ought to do a full linguistic study on this, because it's fascinating how this entire genre has developed. Ideally comparing it to the early lays/medieval romances in the use of tropes and stylistic gestures. Or something.\"}, {'title': 'Den of Vipers', 'author': 'K.A.

In this book they have so many cute scenes at Pike Place and at the Gum Wall and it was so fun to read because I had just been there that day! I absolutely adore this romance series, it\\'s one of my favorites ever!

Upon learning that Darcy is out of town with Elle, Annie spends the weekend with Darcy\\'s brother Brendon, successful app creator and believer in true love, Annie is the exact opposite, sick of the modern dating scene and tired of trying. In just two weeks, Brendon will try to show her that there\\'s more to love than holding on, and that maybe it has even been there all along.Sometimes no plot just vibes really works, and in the case of this novel I didn\\'t mind it one bit.

If there is anything I love, it\\'s a friends to lovers romance where one person has completely given up on love and the other person has to show them what they are missing. Add to the fact that this included cute dates all over Seattle and I was completely sold. Admittedly there was more of a focus on these two characters overcoming emotional barriers and building a relationship, than there was plot, but as this is something the author does incredibly well, it didn\\'t really bother me. Both Annie and Brendon are strong complex characters that you just can\\'t help but root for. I mean Brendon, what can I say, he compared Annie to a potato chip, but made it sound romantic. I just love him so much. What I really did appreciate in this one, was the lack of an unnecessary third act breakup. Nothing against the use of them as a whole, it just definitely was not needed here. These characters were more on a journey towards finding a way to be together, than dealing with an unneeded break up. Bellefleur has once again grabbed my attention with the way she writes romance and showcases queer love. There was so much page time devoted to Elle and Darcy. I loved every moment we got with them. Hang the Moon may have not been up on the exact same level as the previous book, but it was wholesome, cute, and tons of fun.

Well, looks like the gamble might have paid off. This book delivered everything I was hoping to just curl up and relax with. I devoured the story and I loved every character, it was neither lacking in plot nor difficult to wrap my head around. It was just an all-round pleasurable read.I wanted to give it 5 stars.

I\\'ve come to reserve my 5 star ratings for books that challenge my beliefs, make me think, shock me... you get the idea? I loved this book, but did it change my views of the world? No. Okay, I know thatDarkfeverdoesn\\'t exactly contain some hidden message about the state of humanity but, come on...Barrons. There are exceptions to every rule ;)So, yeah, this book was hilarious. No seriously, it was funny enough to giveLouise Rennisona run for her money.

Yes, that\\'s right, I\\'m sat here typing and laughing to myself... it\\'s only a matter of time before they turn up with a straight jacket. What\\'s with the tangents today? Back to what I was saying, there are some extremely funny moments.Julie Jamescreates easily imaginable situations and people so that when she delivers her humour the reader can just imagine it happening.As for the characters, well, Payton is lovable and I recognised something of myself in her because she\\'s a modern independent woman and a feminist, she\\'s ambitious and she\\'s a lawyer (well, I did take a Law A level in sixth form...) but she also wants a man who\\'s a bit of a challenge. A force to be reckoned with wants something to reckon with it, not a pushover. There\\'s a few mild political issues tackled in the story as Payton\\'s mother is a really hardcore feminist and in-your-face vegan. Payton recognises the importance of feminism but that some extremes are unnecessary and cross the line between pro-woman and anti-man. I think it\\'s fair to say I liked her.The sexual tension between Payton and J.D. was really hot, the romantic aspect worked well and (thank you so much Ms James) no insta-love! In fact, at the start of the book they pretty much hated each other... well, in the way two hot lawyers competing for the same job position hate each other (i.e. \"I hate you so much I want to rip your clothes off\"). By the way, J.D. ishot. He\\'s got the whole naughty thing going on without being a complete ass, he made me laugh, he wears a suit *sigh*... and he has short hair, no fangs and isn\\'t called Raphael, Vishous or Angel. Finally!The sex scenes are not graphic but neither are they a \\'fade to black\\' scenario. Sometimes I actually find leaving something to the imagination can be a good thing. That being said, I just finishedJulie James\\' other novel,Something About You, and it seems she\\'s decided to get just a tad dirtier with that one.He goes down on her on the stairs!!!!It was so very very enjoyable and I look forward to reading more books byJulie James. There\\'s something about love/hate banter that really rings my bell. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a lighter kind of read!!Reread 2015This is one of those book that I read when I need something quick to munch on. Something that I already know is going to make me smile and sigh.Except when I was her age, I still thought boys looked like Ken dollsdown there, so I\\'m sure she\\'s smiling about puppies or something...But that\\'s beside the point. Little Rapunzel looks like I felt after reading this. Happy, content, and maybe a bit starry-eyed.And let\\'s face it, when it comes to romance, most of the time I look like this:But this story &Just the Sexiest Man Alive, are the two books that I pick up every few years and read just...because.Are they really both 5 star books?I honestly have no idea at this point. But they fill a Mighty Need in my belly for a bit of fluffy humorous romance every now and then.Practice Makes Perfectdoesn\\'t have much in the way of sex (one or two scenes towards the end), but I actually prefer it that way. I tend to skim over the sexytimes in most books nowadays, anyway. Because if they aren\\'t done toperfectionthey have a tendency to gross me out with all the talk ofjuicesandscents. Sorry, that\\'s just not what I personally want to read about. Reading about someone licking and tasting another person has the same effect on my vagina as spreading my legs under one of those industrial strength hand dryers they have at rest stops. Not only does itnotmake my panties moist, it\\'s like I get early onset menopause.My reaction to reading about smelly dripping bodily fluids?Ok, so in that sense, these books are quite perfect for me. But that\\'s not the only reason I enjoy them. Because if all I wanted was less Sweaty Slip \\'n Slide, I could just avoid romance entirely.Alas, no.I still haveemotionalneeds that must be met. And I\\'ve been married waaay too long to be under the illusion that my husband is going to swoop in and fill that role.I ain\\'t even mad, baby. We\\'ve been staring at each other for too many years to get butterflies in our tummies. Besides, I think that the fact that you don\\'t make (much) fun of the way I fart in my sleep, says something about how much you love me.Still. I\\'m a woman. And as such, I must have (at the very least!) a fantasy life that allows me to get in touch with thatgooey nougatin the center of my soul. And this book lets me safely fantasize about the kind of love that...well, you can only find inbooks.But I could probably find a mushy romance pretty easily. So what sets this book apart from the nine bjillion other romances out there that I\\'ve read?Is the amazingly hawt JD?Well, no. Not really. I mean, he\\'s great, but in real-life he\\'s not my fantasy guy. I mean, he\\'s rich, smart, driven, and in great shape.So, yeah. Who the hell wantsthat?Well, Payton does, even if she won\\'t admit it. She thinks he\\'s nothing but a pompous ass, but, in reality, they could be twins. In fact, they\\'re pretty much just different sides of the same coin. Even though they haveseemto have opposing views on things, they\\'re very similar at their core.Naturally, this causes problems.At first, they were just pseudo-rivals at work. Each trying to outdo the other for some imaginary bragging rights. But due to a new policy their firm enacted, they suddenly becometruerivals in order to win the coveted partnership position.Andhere\\'swhere this book wins me over!For me totrulylove a romance novel, ithasto befunny.James just shines when it comes to writing humorous situations & dialogue! And,yes, it\\'s silly and over the top in instances, but I still laughed at the stuff these two did to each other while trying towinthe partnership spot. Sure, there are a lot ofmisunderstandingsthat complicate matters and lead to problems that could have been easily avoided. And if this were a different book, I\\'d be the first one in line to angrily point out that all the drama was stupid, and that these two would never have acted so unprofessionally, etc.,blah, blah, blah.But, for some reason, I don\\'t mind the nonsenseat all!And when theyfinallyget together?Be still my fluttery little heart...I love this so much! One of my favorites! Read it immediately!Alright, just remember that I warned you that this was an old favorite of mine, so my feelings and opinions might be a bit tainted.No, they\\'re not!I\\'m probably biased, so take my 5 star rating with a grain of salt.Older (much shorter) reviewsI. Loved. It. Ilovedit! This is a great contemporary romance, with some of the funniest scenes and dialogue that I\\'ve read in quite a while! Julie James is definitely going onto my list of Favorite Authors!2012 ReviewFinished a re-read of this a few hours ago, and I\\'m still smiling.sighGod, this is such a cute story!I can\\'t get into this. I can\\'t.The heroine (annoying), the hero (meh) and the plot (boring) are as exciting as watching grass grow.4.5 stars!After eight years of near hostility,Payton KendallandJ.D. Jamesonfind themselves in a head-to-head battle for the partnership position in their law firm. They both excel in their fields––J.D. in class action practice, and Payton in employment law, specifically single-plaintiff race and gender discrimination. There\\'s also an unspoken rule in the firm that the person who does not make partner should \"voluntary\" resign and find another job. Meaning? Only one of them can stay.Not only are they in a competition for the only partnership position currently up for grabs, they are also assigned to woo a potential high profile client, who coincidentally is facing a class action gender discrimination lawsuit. The two have no choice but to handle it together and unfortunately, spend more time with each other.I absolutely enjoy hate-to-love stories, especially ones that remind me of Pride and Prejudice. It\\'s my not-so guilty pleasure! Give me slow burn, witty banter, and the perfect dose of sexual tension, and I\\'m a happy girl.Payton is a badass. The sabotage attempt was hilarious, and if what happened to Payton happened to me, I wouldn\\'t have handled it the way she did. I would\\'ve cried and ran out of the courthouse. But Payton was beauty and grace.She\\'s Miss United States.lol. I kid. But seriously. She\\'s amazing. She\\'s a feminist, and is all for girl power, yet she\\'s not one to disregard men and their merits. I am all over that! I love it.When J.D. was ranting about the workforce \"discrimination\" in their law firm, he sounded like the privileged white man that he is. He\\'s complaining about the 10-percent increase in female partners (there will now be 28% female partners. What a staggering number!!!) and the so-called double-standard white men are suffering. I wanted to smack him upside the head I swear. Hahaha.The playing field ins\\'t level––that\\'s the problem... You know as well as I do that these days, if a man and a woman are equally qualified for a position, the woman gets the job. It\\'s this socially liberal, politically correct society we live in. Men have to be twice as good at what they do to remain competitive in the workplace. Women just have to stay in the race.\"See what I mean?He was an ass, but eventually grew on me because like Mr. Darcy, his personality improved over time. Or rather, his true self came out? I love when brooding men turn into sentimental, sweet marshmallows and ugh. It\\'s adorable.I love Tyler! He gives fantastic advice, and there\\'s a scene where he gives J.D. advice using PRIDE AND PREJUDICE on how to win the girl. It was amazing how knowledgable he was of P&P. I couldn\\'t stop laughing! The taxi driver was a hoot, too....Everybody knows that Darcy doesn\\'t win Lizzy over just by being nice... See, it\\'s all about the Grand Gesture. That\\'s how you get the girl.\"I would have expected Payton\\'s mom to be a possible obstacle since she expressed her concern against old money. After the Father\\'s day brunch, there\\'s little to no mention about Payton\\'s mother.The cause of their eight-year animosity was a bit absurd, if not funny. They wasted eight years because of a petty thing. I almost feel bad for Payton and J.D..My only complaint (if I can even call it that) is that I wasn\\'t a fan of was usingChase Bellamy, good guy that he is, as a plot device. He was used to make Payton see who she really wanted and who she really deserved. After that, he wasn\\'t much in the picture.The sex isn\\'t as steamy as some of the books I\\'ve read, but it works just fine.But still,Practice Makes Perfectwas a funny, romantic, sexy, slow-burn, and swoon-inducing novel, and it\\'s a major plus point that there\\'s a huge Pride and Prejudice influence here, although it\\'s not what I\\'d call a re-telling.Alec Baldwin approves. So do I.So if you\\'re into that, you\\'ll definitely enjoy this lovely piece of gem.(We never did figure out what J.D. means. James Dean Jameson? John Dorian Jameson?)Blog|Facebook|Twitter|InstagramReread Oct\\'2022:I still enjoyed this, but I wasn\\'t nearly as wowed as the first time that I read it.Original rating/review June\\'2011:5++ stars – Contemporary RomanceWOW! I loved it, loved it,lovedit!Something About YouandA Lot Like Loveare two of my favorite contemporary romances and overall reads so far this year and made me an avid Julie James fan. This turned me into an outright rabid, crazed groupie who wants to follow Ms. James around like a puppy, fetch her lattes, shine her Jimmy Choos, and bond with her over martinis. Seriously, she writes some of the snappiest, most intelligently witty dialogue and snarkily clever lines, best laugh out loud scenes, funniest quips, sexiest banter, and hottest hate/love, push/pull tension in romance. Her books read like a favorite romantic comedy movie or TV show rerun that I love watching over and over again.Practice Makes Perfectis one of the most entertaining battle of wills between the sexes and best enemies to lovers, opposites attract romances that I’ve read. It seemed like nearly every page had a humorous, quotable line or scene that I adored and reread several times. Payton and J.D. were an absolute blast riot as they warred with each other and fought the laws of attraction. Their verbal sniping, pun swapping, I-wanna-kiss-you-senseless-even-though-I-wanna-strangle-you sparring, and competitive antics cracked me up!I prefer my romance on the steamy side, and this is definitely no/low heat with only kissing and references to sex between the H/H that occurs off page. But everything else about the book is so utterly amazing that it didn’t matter or lessen my enjoyment one bit. Although I’m definitely glad Ms. James turned the heat way up in her last two releases,Something About YouandA Lot Like Love.Practice Makes Perfectisperfectionand a definite favorite for my keeper shelf! Big 5++ stars!Here are some of my favorite quotes/lines/scenes:***************Possible Spoilers***************“I was just wondering whether your fellow feministas would approve of you using your sexuality as bait.”Payton pulled back. “I’m sorry?”She appeared pissed. Good—this he knew.J.D. pointed to the could-I-sneak-a-peek? V-neck of her shirt. “Planning on showing off the girls tonight, are we? Is that how you plan to impress the Gibson’s execs?”When she turned back to him, her gaze was icy. “We’re asking Gibson’s to give us twenty million dollars in legal fees,” she said coldly. “If you think my boobs are going to land this deal, then they must be even more spectacular than I thought.”“Take it easy on the suit, cupcake. This was hand-tailored in London.” “Oh—I’m sorry. I guess you’ll just have to pick up another one the next time you visit Her Majesty for tea. Isn’t she another friend of the family?”“I think that you are an uptight, pony-owning, trickle-down-economics-loving, Scotch-on-the-rocks-drinking, my-wife-better-take-my-last-name sexist jerk!”“Well, at least I’m not a stubborn, button-pushing, Prius-driving, chip-on-your-shoulder-holding, ‘stay-at-home-mom’-is-the-eighth-dirty-word-thinking feminazi!”He had an image to uphold, after all: he was a corporate defense attorney—he got paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend multimillion-dollar corporations. His clients expected, and paid for, perfection. They did not pay to have their uber-important opposition to class certification motions argued by some jackass who looked like he’d spilled his Dunkin’ Donuts Coffee Coolatta all over himself while driving in from the suburbs in his Ford Taurus. J.D. shuddered at the mere image.“Aren’t you supposed to be married by now to a Muffy or a Bitsy or some other society type with a brain as big as this pickle?”And OMG, the courtroom scene were Payton defended a sexual harassment case in front of a six-foot blown up (pun intended) penis picture while J.D. agonized over whether or not her high heel on the shoe he altered, when he was in a mad fit of revenge, would hold up under the strain had me falling off the couch, snorting with laughter.As did the scene in the cab when J.D. and his best friend, Tyler, discussedPride and Prejudiceand Darcy’s crazy affect on women, with the cabdriver providing some insightful advice as well.“Oh right, P and P,” J.D. said. “You know, Tyler, you might want to pick up your balls—I think they just fell right off when you said that.”'}, {'title': 'Crowns of Nyaxia #2The Ashes & the Star-Cursed King', 'author': 'Carissa Broadbent', 'summary': 'Love is a sacrifice at the altar of power.In the wake of the Kejari, everything Oraya once thought to be true has been destroyed. A prisoner in her own kingdom, grieving the only family she ever had, and reeling from a gutting betrayal, she no longer even knows the truth of her own blood. She’s left only with one certainty: she cannot trust anyone, least of all Raihn.The House of Night, too, is surrounded by enemies. Raihn’s own nobles are none too eager to accept a Turned king, especially one who was once a slave. And the House of Blood digs their claws into the kingdom, threatening to tear it apart from the inside.When Raihn offers Oraya a secret alliance, taking the deal is her only chance at reclaiming her kingdom–and gaining her vengeance against the lover who betrayed her. But to do so, she’ll need to harness a devastating ancient power, intertwined with her father’s greatest secrets.But with enemies closing in on all sides, nothing is as it seems.

I’m debating lowering my rating to two stars. For mediocre smut, boring scenes, and no revenge arc, this 650 pages long book was 550 pages way too long.Let’s get right into it because the more I think about it, more angry I get.Warning!This review will involve a lot of cursing and spoilers for the first book. The first portion of the review will be spoiler free, the second part will involve minor and big spoilers for this book but I’ll put up multiple warnings before that part so you can avoid it. (Honestly, you should let me spoil this book for you and save you the trouble because it is not worth it.)Oraya, The Fucking DisappointmentThis is gonna be the longest section of this review so buckle up!What the actual fuck happened to this girl? She was about to be my favorite MC but with this book she became the most hated one. The bane of my existence. If you like Oraya go ahead and skip this book. Seriously. Do yourself a favor and just don’t read it.Throughout the book, Oraya never tries to get revenge.NEVER.She half-heartedly tries to tip off her people so they can attack Raihn’s armory and that’s it. I’m not even kidding, and believe me I wish I was. Raihn killed her father, took the throne that was rightfully hers, killed her people, forced her hand to marriage, and held her captive in her own goddamn house and she never tries to get revenge? Or help her own people? Or at least try to get her throne back? What the fuck was that?(Side note:The marriage bit happens at the beginning of this book and honestly, it’s not important to the plot or the characters so you can just forget about it.)And no Oraya, making him beg to fuck you as a sex fantasy is not revenge nor empowering. It’s actually cringy.In the first book Oraya was angry, hateful, reserved, and fucking violent. The excellent build-up for her to become a vengeful character. She used to go to the streets and kill vampires to calm down. In this book Oraya has the personality of a scarecrow. Actually, “scarecrow” is not the right word given that they at least have fucking backbones and stand their ground. The things Oraya lacks in this book.Not to mention how Oraya from the first book wouldNEVERforgive Raihn in two months and spit on Vincent’s grave. Her loyalty to her father evaporates the moment Raihn takes his dick out. Vincent raised you for 16 years, protected you, trained you, and kept you safe just for you to turn your back on him the moment he’s dead. Make it make sense.“But Vincent lied and kept secrets from her!”Shut the fuck up. First of all if you think your parents are always truthful to you, you need to go out and touch some grass. Secondly, Vincent did those things for justifiable reasons one of them being him wanting to keep her safe. She forgives Raihn, the guy she has known for less than a year, for all the shit he has done but she can’t forgive Vincent, her own father, for keeping secrets? Spare me.Raihn, Just Die AlreadyHe needs to do all of us a favor and set himself on fire. Honestly. He is giving toxic boy vibes who keeps saying“No no no, you don’t get it! I’m actually a decent person!”Other than him being an entitled brat, there is nothing to say about him because Oraya is the actual villain here. Anyway.His shitty interludes made me wanna take a lovely lovely bath with my toaster. We already walked through his story in the first book, those chapters in this book were unnecessary not to mention annoying.OKAY WE GET IT, YOU RE SAD AND POETIC AND YOU CRY ALL THE TIME. WOO-HOO POOR RAIHN.It was also so weird that he kept thinking about his ex all the damn time. Like, are you sure you are in love with Oraya?Also, I dare Raihn to think or say“There she is.”One more fucking time. ONE MORE TIME. Say it to my face. I swear to gods even writing that sentence is pissing me off at this point.The Writing, the Plot, and Everything in BetweenThe villains were weak which made the whole story arc about them weak and boring. They had no personalities or original motives. It didn’t help that we didn’t get to know them at all. They were cartoonish. In my book, a weak villain/antagonist means a bad plot.The writing was okay-ish. It had a lot of useless and frankly boring details but that’s not even the main issue. The main issue is how the author failed to write different characters. She shouldn’t have tried to write dual POVs because they all just sounded the same. At some point, I started a chapter without checking whose POV it was and for the better half of it, I thought I was reading from Oraya’s POV and I wouldn’t have noticed it was Raihn if it wasn’t for his obsessive thoughts about his ex.This book butchered the build-up and the cliffhanger the first book provided. None of it mattered in this book. Such a waste.This book also uses the same plot devices of the first book, almost exactly the same. I’m sorry but that’s lazy writing.I honestly don’t know what happened to Mische, she was completely stripped of any and all personality traits. She just popped then and there to smile and nothing else. We can take her scenes out of this book and nothing would change.After Lilith and Vale’s novella, I expected to see them more but they barely had any scenes which was disappointing. (I also suggest that we get a novella like Six Scorched Roses about Vincent and Alana’s past. It would be beautiful and devastating.)Cyra’s InterludeI decided to lower my rating to two stars because I’m bitter.THE NEXT PART WILL INVOLVE SPOILERS FOR THIS BOOK.YOU’VE BEEN WARNED.STOP READING NOW.I’ll use this portion to rant.First of all, can we talk about their cringy-ass sex scene, mostly about how they did it at the worst time possible? Did they have to do it while there was a coup going on? Mische, Raihn’s one and only family, everyone they’ve ever known, and their fucking kingdom was in danger and they chose to spend their timeLIKE THAT?Not to mention how they almost died and were still bleeding? They had time to heal or plan something to get everyone out but no, they had to had sex. Great going guys, you two will rule this kingdom splendidly.Secondly, I hated how Oraya gave everything she had worked so hard for up to save Raihn’s assONCE AGAIN.I already talked about how the author used the plot devices of the first book in this one but I have to mention this again.ORAYA BE SERIOUS RIGHT NOW, THIS ISN’T YOU.I can somehow justify your stupidity once but twice? This is too much.“Unlike my dad, I chose love over power.”Acting like it’s a lesson she just learned and hasn’t been bending over backward to make Raihn happy. This also butchered the potential character development too. Raihn always, and I’m not even kidding, he always got what he wanted without any problems while Oraya put her life on the line and worked her ass off to please him.THE END OF SPOILERSThis was one of the longest reviews I’ve ever written and I’m still angry. Don’t waste your time with this book.4.5 STARS!\"Yours,\" I ground out. \"It\\'s yours.\" My blood. My body. My soul. I had given her all of that a long time ago. I even had given her my life. And I\\'d do it all again.I needed to process this book for a day before writing my review bc the emotions that it wrung from me were truly raw. We are back with Oraya and Raihn after the fallout of the Kejari. Oraya feeling betrayed, Raihn struggling to step into his new role as King and both of them still surrounded by enemies and danger. They both must deal with their individual horrifying and complicated pasts and determine if they can trust each other again and what that may mean for themselves and an entire kingdom.\"I was the Heir of the House of Night, and I was the daughter of Vincent the Nightborn King, and I was every bit as powerful as both those things suggested.\"I loved this book, I didn\\'t think it was quite as good as the first book though but only because I thought there was some redundant storylines, And the pacing could have been a little tighter in my opinion. While I didn\\'t struggle to place a rating, I did struggle about whether or not to rate up or down and ultimately the answer was up and can be explained with one name, which I will get to later. But I also never highlighted a book as much as this one, so many beautiful quotes and the writing was stunning. The action scenes in these books are always heart pounding and expertly written. I also really loved the side characters and all the surprises we got from Oraya\\'s past. AND THE LOVE STORY!!! GAH!!! \\U0001fae0I also really loved how the scale of the world expanded and we were able to learn and experience more about the kingdom of Obitraes and the other houses. But for me personally the ongoing storyline between Oraya and Vincent is what sets this book apart. They have such a tumultuous and beautifully complicated relationship and at one point in this book my heart cracked open for them.\"Losing my trust in Vincent was more than losing my trust in a single person. It had broken something within me, destroyed my ability to put that trust into anyone else.\"CHARACTERSOraya- Saying Oraya had some stuff to process in this book is definitely an understatement. My girl was in the thick of it, between trying to reconcile her grief with the passing of her father and his lies about her entire existence and her feelings of betrayal from Raihn and then add in the responsibility of being the heir and leader to her people, something she never thought would land on her shoulders, my little serpent handled it about as well as anyone could honestly. I appreciated her falling back on her training and also keeping her wits about her as we have come to expect from her character, (even though I do think she made my poor man Raihn sweat it out a lot longer than he deserved!!) Vincent\\'s constant voice in her head was both comforting and painful and I really felt her inner conflict.\"Because that name was all those things, wasn\\'t it? Raihn. My downfall and my most valuable supporter. My weakness and my strength. My worst enemy and the greatest love I had ever known.\"Rhain- AHHH this man!!! He is as close to perfection as it gets. And how can you deny a man that begs?! 😍\\U0001fae0 I loved the conflict he had trying to marry his past to the expectations of his new role as King. I think that his ability to be self-aware and acknowledge his strengths and weaknesses and allow those around him to help him fill in the gaps was refreshing and progressive, but let\\'s be real it\\'s all about his love for Oraya! This man is the ultimate simp for his woman and I am HERE FOR IT!!!\"Let me make you the Queen that you are. Let me guard your body, your soul, your heart. Let me spend the rest of my fucking pathetic life at your mercy. If I need to die, then let me do it by your hand. Please.\"\"I\\'d spend a lifetime at the tip of your blade, and it would have been worth it.\"\"And for fuck\\'s sake princess, I\\'m begging you, let me go my knees for you.\"\"Maybe I just imagined that the entire world stopped when my wife walked into the ballroom.\"Vincent- This is why I rated up. This man cracked my heart wide open and I was left bleeding out, crying on the floor for about twenty minutes. I was not expecting him to have such a centrical presence and storyline in this book and it was a tipping point for me bc it was one of the most emotionally complex and beautiful storylines I have read in a fantasy romance in a very long time. Vincent is the embodiment of an enigma. His love for Oraya, as flawed and imperfect as it may have been, was also very genuine and the only redeeming quality he probably ever had. He also never had the skills to reconcile his true nature with the love he had for his daughter and therein lies the true heartbreaking tragedy of it all.\"I was expecting to kill you that night. But what I was not expecting was to love you so devastatingly much. It hits me so suddenly, so overwhelmingly, that I don\\'t even have time to brace myself against it.\"I am kind of sad that Oraya and Raihn\\'s main storyline is over bc I am left wanting so much more! I can\\'t wait to continue these books bc Carissa Broadbent is so masterfully building such an amazing and epic series and I can\\'t wait to see what happens next bc that ending and the foreshadowing of the threat that is definitely going to come has my anxiety through the roof! 💙💙💙LIVES WERE CHANGED AND PEOPLE DIED!!!

I wanted to savor him like blood. I wanted him to open me and touch everything within me that I had hidden away from the world.” Oraya the things I would do for you…🧚\\u200d♀️Raihn! goddamn the turnaround this man made on me!! i love that he was a full fledged character that had a personality outside of being obsessed with Oraya. this man had me in a headlock. we get more of his past in this book and character development/growth. the way he literally BEGS Oraya. it’s like nothing i’ve read before. he’s so submissive and breedable. all around the babiest babygirl of all time. the way he’s idealistic, compassionate, charming, respects boundaries and supports his powerful girlfriend!!! had me giddy and kicking my feet!! i want him till my kidneys stop filtering…\\U0001fae3“i’d spend a lifetime at the tip of your blade, and it would have been worth it.” when the enemies to lovers are still enemies to lovering>>>\\U0001faf6🏽“Let me make you the Queen that you are. Let me guard your body, your soul, your heart. Let me spend the rest of my fucking pathetic life at your mercy. If I need to die, then let me do it by your hand. Please.” tell me why i folded like a chair?!?their dynamic is so powerful. the “there she is” to the “you’re safe” man why was i tearing up 🥲 the writing in this book is like no other. I’ll be reading this author’s entire backlist before I die.this book was pure cunt! the passion!! the electricity!! i love this series to the depths of my soul. i was a completely different bitch prior to reading this series. i can’t comprehend that none of it was real and that i’m simply expected to move on with my life 😖💔in conclusion, they survived the great war…hmm. i feel like im missing something because everyone is waxing poetic over this sequel, but i personally dont think its as good as the first book.does this tick a lot of boxes? yeah, it does. theres decent world-building, reliable fantasy elements, a plot that makes sense, and a romance the reader can root for. but boy, oh boy, is this lacking in a lot of other areas.the main characters feels so bland compared to what they were in the first book. and the villains are too one-dimensional, leaving me wanting more from them. the writing is also very repetitive and could have used to some editing, because the slow pacing and long length just isnt a winning combination for me.and while the first book wasnt perfect either, i did find it highly entertaining. and this one just doesnt have that same kind of spark, unfortunately. so not sure if im willing to give the series another try when the next book comes out or not. i guess we will see.↠3 starsThere she is. 🙄'}, {'title': 'Eligible: A Modern Retelling of Pride & Prejudice', 'author': 'Curtis Sittenfeld', 'summary': \"This version of the Bennet family and Mr. Darcy is one that you have and haven't met before: Liz is a magazine writer in her late thirties who, like her yoga instructor older sister, Jane, lives in New York City.

It\\'s just, \"Gasp! The Bennet girls are in interracial/transgender relationships in 2016! Is that progressive?!\"The trans character is drawn as duplicitous and Mrs. Bennet, described by the author throughout the book as \"a racist,\" is also transphobic. Both traits are tra rated as some folksy quirk attributable to age and life as a Midwesterner. Characters go out of their way to enable and accommodate Mrs. Bennet\\'s prejudices, coming up with truly appalling \"explanations\" of what it means to be trans (Darcy tells her it\\'s a birth defect, no different than a cleft palate. Seriously.) Mr. Bennet is also prejudiced to a less blatant/vocal degree. His comments are rendered as good-natured ribbing and it\\'s just as grating.Sittenfeld only seeks to offset all these instances of bias and gross offense by having Liz use Google to quickly \"learn\" about trans identity and calls herself \"newly enlightened\" after doing so. Liz does the same with black characters. If her mother says something blatantly racist, the narration is sure to give Liz internal monologue that basically says, \"I know better, though. I\\'m not like my mother at all. See how I know better?\"There are wholly unnecessary racialized interactions here. Liz, at one point distraught over Darcy, goes jogging and encounters a black woman whose only function in the narrative is to say, \"Honey? Are you all right, honey?\" There was no reason at all to describe this character as black. She only exists for half a paragraph, for the sole purpose of consoling the lead with an overly familiar term of endearment -- of the type black maids are constantly being described as having used with white families.SPEAKING OF MAIDS. There\\'s a whole weird thread about \"Mervetta,\" the deceased longtime Bennet maid who the matriarch had fired. Liz is surprised to learn that her father and one of her sisters were nice enough to attend her funeral anyway. It\\'s a strange way to \"contemporize\" the original work. Nothing contemporary about writing in a black maid who was \"like part of the family\" until you fired her.This book never misses an opportunity to make cheap race and gender jokes by placing the punchlines within the mouths of the book\\'s more unlikable characters (they\\'re all unlikable except Jane and Jane is wildly underwritten).Eligible is also just poorly written. The sentences are (possibly intentionally, given the source material) far too flowery -- even to describe things like eating chili in a fast food restaurant or cleaning out a basement. The reality show conceit is poorly executed (more of a frame -- given attention only in the beginning of the book and in its last few chapters -- rather than something to hang the whole book on, title/premise-wise).Also grating: the very last mini-chapter is about a Bennet sister whose internal life has not once been explored elsewhere, but suddenly we\\'re deep in her brain as she extols the virtues of being on a bowling league.Ugh. I just hated this. I hated its casual racism, homophobia, and transphobia and I hated how proud of herself the author seemed in \"tackling\" race and gender. She did such an unrepentantly horrible job at it.You don\\'t \"update\" classics by slotting in a trans character for shock factor (there are literal omg texts exchanged over this \"reveal\" and the character is made to apologize for \"misleading\" the family). You don\\'t use a character\\'s race alone as a stand-in for progressivism. Like, \"Oh, she\\'s dating a black guy and his skin color is noteworthy enough to mention but none of his other character traits are. But see how we\\'re not really saying too much about how he\\'s black and in our family? Aren\\'t we tolerant?\"In closing, this sucked. Don\\'t waste your time.Pride and Prejudice, as great a piece of literature as it is, is largely a parody of its time. Mrs. Bennet\\'s desperate hunt for suitable husbands for her girls, the resigned Mr. Bennet, the silliness of the younger Bennet girls, the commentary on social class. The humor and wit is quite subtle, but - Liz an Darcy\\'s romance aside - it is a parody just the same. In that sense,Eligibleis a great homage to it. It is filled with wit and dry humor, a rare thing these days.This book is a lot more obvious, and rather louder in its humor than the original, which is to be expected, considering the times. It is adapted to the modern day, and as such, some people might find the situations more crude (for example, Bingley first appeared in a version ofThe Bachelor), but one can\\'t deny that back then, as it is now, marriage is but a game. If you think about it, the situations aren\\'t too different, for after all, a host of desperate beauties are being paraded in front of an eligible bachelor in the hopes of getting a ring. It just wasn\\'t televised back in Austen\\'s days. Neither could you google a potential suitor.FITZWILLIAM DARCY ATHERTON, CA, Liz typed into Google, and after reading through the results, she tried, sequentially, Fitzwilliam Darcy Harvard Medical School, Fitzwilliam Darcy University of Cincinnati Comprehensive Stroke Center, and, just for the hell of it, Fitzwilliam Darcy girlfriend.The sisters have been updated quite admirably. All are adults, most living at home with their weary parents, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. They were all expensively educated, and besides Jane and Liz, most are doing absolutely nothing with their lives, unless you consider Crossfit lessons a lifelong calling (I say that in jest, although if you ask a Crossfitter, I\\'m sure they\\'ll actually agree). The sisters are rather true to the original, down to Mary\\'s tendency to annoy the living shit out of people and her dad\\'s tendency to wish he had had a vasectomy.“Tease me all you like, but the clock is ticking. No, Jane doesn’t look like she’ll be forty in November, but any man who knows her age will think long and hard about what that means. And Liz isn’t far behind her.”“Plenty of men don’t want children.” Mr. Bennet took a sip of coffee. “I’m still not sure that I do.”In this book, Darcy is a neurosurgeon, and our first impression of him ain\\'t that great.“Here’s what I’ve learned about the people in this city,” Darcy was saying. “They grade their women on a curve. If someone is described as sophisticated, it means once during college she visited Paris, and if someone is described as beautiful, it means she’s fifteen pounds overweight instead of forty.\"He\\'s talking about Cincinnati, a city that\\'s not exactly on my bucket list, but still. Ouch.One of my few complaints about this book is that it does have a tendency to be verbose. The narrative is pretty funny, but it often rambles into people and subjects I feel are space fillers. Sittenfeld has a talent for writing, and as such, the rambling is quite easy to read, but it does make the book feel overly long. Despite that, the book is an admirable homage toPride and Prejudice.I received this book as an advanced reader\\'s copy.It\\'s a little ridiculous how well done this rebelling of pride and prejudice is. So sharp and clever. The Bennetts are wholly annoying but well drawn characters. The book is faithful to the source in the necessary ways but also fresh in surprising ways. Really liked how Darcy and Liz\\'s relationship evolved. Took a while to get into the book but once I was hooked I finished it in one setting.”My dear,” said Mr. Bennett, “if a sock puppet with a trust fund and a Harvard medical degree moved here, you’d think he was meant to marry one of our girls.”It is a truth universally acknowledged that, like the works of William Shakespeare andBill Finger, some stories demand reinterpretation every generation or so. Using the ancient structures provides a framework within which the re-inventor can bring to the older foundations and i-beams some more contemporary facades. The one that stands out best for me is a reinterpretation of Richard the Third, the one with Ian McKellan, in which Dickie has been transformed, through the use of genius-level staging, from a sociopathic, murderousdwarfto a Hitlerian monster practicing his calumny on a much larger scale.And so it is with the works of Jane Austen. The large and small screens of the world have rarely gone long without some production or other ofEmma, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, Mansfield ParkorNorthanger Abbey(evenSanditonhas now (2020) found its way to the screen), but the lord/lady of this manor is certainlyPride and Prejudice. From 1940, when Greer Garson and Lawrence Olivier butted heads to 2003 (set in Utah), barely a hiccup before getting to it again in 2005 (impatient, weren’t they, but worth it to see Keira and Matthew directed by Joe Wright), and thenA Modern Pride and Prejudicein 2011, P&P has been a big screen presence as long as there have been big screens. 2016’sPride and Prejudice and Zombiesprobably doesn’t count. And I undoubtedly missed a few. Yes, yes, I know,Bridget Jones, but I was looking for productions using the P&P title. There have been plenty of TV productions as well, beginning with a 1952 version that featured Peter Cushing. There was another in 1967, ditto in 1980, once more in 1995 (Colin Firth), then again in 2014. And we won’t even go into how many episodes of various TV series dipped into the Austen well. As for books, (throws hands in the air and runs, screaming from the room) I spotted a list on GR ofBest Pride and Prejudice Sequels/Variations/Adaptationsthat listed 278 individual books. With so many folks having had a go at this material, why another one? Well, because the source material is amazing and a well-written update can be both entertaining and illuminating.Curtis Sittenfeld- fromhttp://wvxu.org/Eligibleis Curtis Sitenfeld’s fifth novel. She is best known forPrep, a coming-of-age novel that won her wide acclaim. While I did not find her adaptation ofPride and Prejudicequite so striking as that of the above-noted Shakespearean update, she has done an excellent job of providing a 21st century venue for early 19th century situations (or would that be eternal human situations?)-. Some arrive more easily than others. Dinner parties may be less of a thing than they once were, but serve well enough to support structures in which the kids can run around and bump into each other. Liz Bennett overhears a condescension-rich sort ragging on her home town and the quality of the local females just as readily here, at an informal gathering, as her progenitor did at a more dressed up event two hundred years prior. The barbs sting as much, well, nearly as much as they once did. The retorts have lost none of their satisfying spice. Humans have never been short on either pride or prejudice, so there is always plenty of both to go around, whatever century we may be in, at whatever location.It is no accident that this version opens with society looking at marriage as a game. Finding a suitable life partner remains a kind of contest, with competitors, prizes, winners and losers, hopefully some fun, and plenty of intermittent challenges. Maybe today, in a throw-away culture, the romantic relationship, if not marriage itself, (although far too often, marriage itself) has become more like the Andy Warholian fifteen minute spotlight. Once the contest is over, time to move on to the next stimulant. Let’s see, what’s onthischannel. There is, in this regard, less at issue now than was the case two hundred years ago, when women’s choices were far more constrained. The socio-economic costs of not finding a suitable husband were more existentially severe in the early 19th century than they are today, when options are considerably broader and attitudes often border on “whatever.” Chip Bingley, excuse me,DoctorChip Bingley, was the object of a televised game, a clone ofThe Bachelor, calledEligible. A flock of lovelies cooed and fluttered through a TV season’s worth of mating game, yet, lo and behold, here he is in Cincinnati, still looking for love. And he is a peach, ladies. He brings with him a notable pal. And the game is afoot.Instead of a lord of a manor, the contemporary tall, dark, and snotty Fitzwilliam Darcy is presented as a sort of ideal man, physically sculpted, disgustingly well-off, professionally accomplished, and let’s not pretend this is a spoiler, he turns out to be a pretty decent guy. He’s good to the help, is an excellent listener. Oh yeah, this is the 21st century, so toss in great in bed. And not just brilliant, not just a doctor, but a brain surgeon. Really? I would hesitate to suggest that anything he does is not exactly rocket science lest we be informed that he dabbles in designing manned-launch capability in his free time. This guy should be tested for GMOs. His lily is so gilded it needs a truss to hold it up. Of course Sittenfeld may be having a bit of fun with her readers by going so over the top in portraying the brooding catch that she is in danger of falling into the neighbor’s yard. At least she had the decency to keep him socially awkward and a bit clueless, if educable, aboutl\\'0affaires de cœur.And just in case you need some reminding, the Bennets now, as then, are an upper middle class family who find themselves under considerable economic strains. The new mechanisms for this misery are particularly attuned to today. Dad’s health issues have kicked up a notch so the daughters are all back together again to lend support, a few having actual lives elsewhere. The less than wonderful mother hen is very eager to see that her five daughters secure their futures by latching on to mates with the means to take care of them. It is now as it was then in this portrayal. The ages of the players have changed a wee bit. The lovely Jane, delight of all, is nearing 40. If she was zen in the 1800s, she is even more so now, as a yoga instructor. Liz, the heart of the tale, is not far behind, age-wise. Her affinity for words makes her a writer for a magazine today. Thirty-year-old Mary stands off, as she did in her earlier incarnation. The younger sorts. Kitty and Lydia, are presented as giddy twenty-somethings now instead of giddy teens. Ain’t extended childhood wonderful? They are pretty reliably awful more than not. And Lydia’s sexual adventurousness stands out now as it did in the original. Our Wickham, Jasper Wick, can be relied on to be of less than sterling character. (Maybe from burning the candle at both ends?)There are parallels aplenty with the source material. From the names to the track of the characters’ interactions. Just as P&P dealt in real-world sorts of people (Yeah, the Bennetts, more or less, not Darcy and Bingley) so doesEligible. Extract one quirk of English property law and substitute, quite cleanly, some very 21st century mechanisms for potentially stripping a family of their assets.Plus ça change, different century, same class system. As with the original this is a story about choices and responsibility. Austen’s Bennett sisters faced more of a societal challenge at the time than the more contemporary Bennetts do today. An unmarried woman was condemned to being seen as a spinster, an old maid, someone of marginal value. Women have more freedom today, to have careers, to decide who to be with, male or female, whether that entails marriage or passing relationships, or to opt out of the dating game entirely if they prefer, without becoming social pariahs.I do take slight issue with Sittenfeld’s choice for a burg. Really? Cincinnati? It may not exactly be New York, London or Paris, but it is hardly the outback. Well,tie me kangaroo down, sport, now there’s an idea! A sheep farm on the edge of Nowhere, Australia. Hugh Jackman or Eric Bana as Darcy, Chris Hemsworth as Chip Bingley, Geoffrey Rush or John Noble as Papa Bennett, Sam Worthington as Wickham, Jackie Weaver as Mom Bennett, Mia Wasikowska as Jane, maybe Rose Byrne for Liz. Substitute town barbeques for the dinner parties or fancy dress balls and watch the ‘Roos have at it. I’d pay to see that. But I digress, however giddily. Sittenfeld is actually from…well…one guess. Her brother is a city councilman there. So I suppose her choice of settings was either based on wanting to dis or celebrate her place of origin (particularly a favorite eatery) or maybe her familiarity offered her the advantage of bringing in a lot of local touch and feel. Either way, whatever. Cincy it is. Sorry, Ohio.I was particularly fond of papa Bennett’s mordant wit, but was disappointed when it seemed to almost vanish from the book as the story moved on. Mama Bennett was pretty awful, but I suppose the original was no prize either. One would have expected Liz to have seen through the BS of a person she was close to rather sooner than she does. I know people can be dim. Count me among them. But really, Liz?So, isEligiblea good read? Only an uneducated rube, someone with poor breeding would think not. You’re not one of those, are you? Was the original? Of course it was. This one bubbles aplenty with ST (Sexual Tension), snootiness of various sorts, and egos desperately in need of puncturing. There are misunderstandings, errors in judgment, wrong turns and mistakes enough to populate a screwball comedy of another bygone era. And there is also plenty of caring, genuine affection and human connection to balance the awfulness quite nicely.You may or may not bebewitched, body and soul. You may or may not want to put a ring onEligible, but you should certainly consider bringing it home to meet the family. And if you are feeling disinclined, all I can say is get over yourself. Don’t be so judgmental.Review posted – January 22, 2016Publication date – April 19, 2016I received an ARE of this book from Random House, ‘cause they must like my face.=============================EXTRA STUFFAn aside.

Which means I don\\'t deduct points for the theatrical love scenes or the campy dialogue.I mean, are there really guys out there whohiss through their clenched teethwhen they\\'re aroused? Sure, I\\'ve heard my husbandhiss, but it was because one of the kids accidentally clocked him in the nuts with a toy.If he had hissed at me while we were dating, I don\\'t think we\\'d be married right now to be quite honest with you.Like the majority of every romance novel, the hero and heroine have to overcome a multitude of obstacles in order to find their Happily Ever After.In this case, theobstacleis the hero\\'s snobbery.Ok. I like the stories with the rigid hero and the carefree heroine. Usually, it\\'s fun to watch them argue and clash.Not so much in this case.Simon thinks Juliana is below him, and Juliana wants to teach him a lesson.So far, so good!If she had teased and tortured him, this would have been a fun little story. But that\\'snotwhat happened.Basically, she has the hots for him, so she (somehow) gets him to agree to this weirdo bet that made no sense.

I had very high expectations, and I’m thrilled to say that it left a big happy satisfied smile on my face. I love ‘opposites attract’ stories and the romance between passionate, feisty, spitfire Juliana and the haughty, proper, disdainful Duke of Leighton was pure combustible magic!Juliana Fiori is a fiery Italian miss who longs to break free of the stifling rules and cutting gossip of thetonand the unfeeling, stuffy, arrogant Duke of Leighton represents everything she loathes about English society and propriety. Scandalous Juliana is bold, brash, reckless, expressive, outspoken, and deeply passionate...everything that the Duke of Leighton wants desperately to avoid.With a family legacy to uphold and shocking secrets to protect, Leighton values his prestigious title, sterling reputation, and impeccable position in society above all else. So his intense attraction to Juliana is unbearable and unwanted. Leighton’s scorn makes Juliana seethe with frustration and hurt, and she’s determined to prove to him that passion is more powerful than the Duke’s status and rules of decorum. Juliana is the perfect match that ignites the banked fire inside Simon, and their volatile connection threatens to shatter the Duke of Disdain’s staunchly guarded control.It’s a wonderful, engaging, emotional, utterly enjoyable, and unforgettable romance with witty dialogue, hot sexual tension, the perfect combination of drama and humor, a lovable, brave yet vulnerable heroine, and a sexy hero whose aloof, haughty veneer masks a passionate man. I loved it just as much, if not more than,Nine Rules to Break When Romancing a Rake. It’s a definite keeper worthy ofvery big5 stars! I really hope this isn’t the last book of the series because Benedick and Georgiana need their own stories and HEAs.Juliana (Italian actress Monica Bellucci)Simon (Model Gabriel Aubry)This book was very, very, good, but I must admit the hero, Simon Pearson (the Duke of Leighton) at times drove me absolutelycrazy! All that worrying about his family\\'s reputation...his position...finding the perfect wife...avoiding any hint of scandal...arrgh! God, was he frustrating! At times I wanted to throttle him the way he continually hurt Juliana, and Juliana...I don\\'t know why she didn\\'t give up on him! But...I\\'m glad she didn\\'t! It took over 350 pages for Simon to finally get a clue, but when he did, all my frustrations just melted away, and I adored him as much as Juliana did.:)Simon/ Duke of Leighton...No plot summary here--the book blurb does a good job of explaining what this one is all about. This one was hard to put down-- even though I had my issues with \"the Duke of Disdain\"-- and I enjoyed every page of it. Sarah MacLean is a wonderful storyteller and made me fall in love with her characters once again--the enchanting, beautiful,passionate, spirited Juliana Fiori (half sister to the St. John brothers fromNine Rules to Break When Romancing a RakeandTen Ways to Be Adored When Landing a Lord) , and the handsome, imperious,stubbornDuke of Leighton.Juliana...Lots of playful banter, lots of predicaments that Juliana gets herself into (the girl was a bit clumsy), a touch of humor, and plenty of heat (and some tearful moments) in this one. I enjoyed seeing Leighton fall helplessly under Juliana\\'s spell, but I had to wonder--what took him so long?My favorite part, when Leighton finally \"gets it\":\"I have spent my entire life preparing for a cold, unfeeling, unimpassioned life--a life filled with pleasantries and simplicity. And then you came into it...you...the opposite of all that. You are beautiful and brilliant and bold and so very passionate about life and love and those things that you believe in. And you taught me that everything I believe, everything I thought I wanted, everything I spent my life espousing--all of it...it is wrong. I want your version of life...vivid and emotional and messy and wonderful and filled with happiness. But I cannot have it without you...\"If you\\'ve read and enjoyed the previous two books in this series, you\\'ll definitely want to read this one. Juliana is a wonderfully sympathetic character who teaches Leighton the meaning of passion, and most importantly,love. At the beginning of the book, be prepared to dislike him (my first thoughts about him were \"what a pompous ass\"). But give him a chance--he\\'s got a terrible upbringing to overcome, so he doesn\\'t know much about love--and by the end of the book you be rooting for him to say (and do) the right thing that will win Juliana.

Then you giggled.”She made a derisive sound. “I’ve never giggled in my life.”“Oh, yeah, you did. You giggled and squirmed and wriggled around until I was so worked up I thought I’d explore.”“Foolish, foolish boy. When you wrestle naked with a female, she’s bound to discover just where your brain cells have gathered.”“You were fifteen. What did you know?”Now she smirked. “Enough to wriggle and squirm until I obtained a satisfactory result.”“You did it on purpose?”“Of course.”“That better be a lie.” He reached across the water, grabbed a handful of her hair. He tugged at her hair until their bodies bumped. He trailed a fingertip down her torso, back up again. “I bet I can still make you giggle.”Before she could evade, he nipped her by the waist and turned her facedown in the water. Taken by surprise, she flailed for a moment, then rolled when his fingers moved unerringly up her ribs. “Stop it.” Her hair was in her face, saltwater in her eyes.“Giggle,” he insisted, tickling ruthlessly. “And squirm and wiggle.”“You idiot.”She couldn’t see or catch her breath. Despite her struggles the helpless and foolish laughter escaped. It rolled out of her and over the waves as she slapped at him and tried to wiggle free.༄ He whispers sweet nothings in Gaelic during the steamy scenes *faints* I didn’t know whether to swoon or start Googling translations (spoiler alert: I did both)༄ When he calls her baby 🥰“Don’t sit on the–” She bit off a sigh because he’d already lowered himself to the coffee table facing her. “I see you never have figured out the difference between a table and a chair.”“They’re both in the furniture family. There, you’ve got some color coming back. Good thing I came along to annoy you.”“Just my lucky day.” He took her hand again, warming it in his. “What scared you, baby?”༄ Strong female friendships. Woohoo! Girl power! 🌸🎀🦩💕🌷👛 Nell, Lulu & Ripley were so loyal and supportive of Mia. They were all genuinely happy for each other when they succeeded in something and it was so heartwarming :,) I love to see women supporting women. No girls hating on girls in this house 😎 Mia’s friendship with Zack was also adorable༄ Ripley. She’s sassy, loud and witty. I loved all the side characters, but she was my favorite.༄ Zack & Nell, the healthiest and happiest married couple. They communicate, compromise and cherish each other—the three Cs༄ Sam isn’t shy about the fact that he’s obsessed with her. I love a man who isn’t afraid to shout their love and adoration from the rooftops.“Your neighbor isn’t gullible or naive.”“No, she’s just the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known.”༄ When he said he’d prefer death over not touching her lol“Touch me. Don’t stop touching me.” He’d have cheerfully died first.Recommendation:If you want another witchy second-chance, childhood friends to lovers romance, check out Witch of Wild Things by Raquel Vasquez Gilliland. Happy reading! :)This closes out the series. It\\'s not that I didn\\'t love it, cause I did. But...ok, here\\'s the deal. He dumps her harshly and then ten years later he returns expecting to romance her back into his bed.What he didn\\'t bank on was how much her heart was broken. He knew he hurt her. \"I did mean to hurt you. And I\\'d say I did a damn good job of it.\" Yep, he would have needed an ambulance after making a comment like that. 🚑She rebuilt herself on the ashes he left. She was stronger, but he does manage to romance himself back in, slowly.As you can tell, I never warmed up to him. But it was still an excellent ending to the series.While I still liked this book, it was my least favorite of the Three Sisters Island trilogy. I liked the plot as it dealt with resolving the threat to the island and beating the evil. I thought that was done well.What I didn\\'t particularly like about the book was the romance between Mia and Sam. It didn\\'tquitework for me. Mia keeps her heart locked away from Sam for the whole book (with good reason mostly) then at the end, she\\'s suddenly like, okay, I accept you and your love. The abrupt change in her feelings came off a little...weird for me. Their romance just has this rather cold vibe. She sleeps with him, does things with him, but she\\'s constantly saying \"I\\'ll never risk my heart again\" and saying it\\'s just sex and fun. I would have liked to see Mia soften toward him a little more before the end.The other thing that kept me from really loving the book was Mia herself. I just didn\\'t like her as much as the other characters. Maybe it was her attitude and arrogance...I\\'m not sure. But at times for me, she was just a character who was there, not one I was actively rooting formBut aside from that, still a good book and a nice conclusion to the Three Sisters Island trilogy...which is my favorite of all Nora\\'s trilogies.This reunion story didn\\'t work for me. I was too busy rolling my eyes to fully enjoy this corny mess.The hero dumped the heroine because he felt suffocated by her and doesn\\'t return for 11 years. She, of course spent those years torn apart, struggling to survive without him. The day he returns, she decides she will have sex without the \"relationship\" with him *rolls eyes* when he tells her he wants her back. Does that sound like what a rational woman will do to the guy who dumped and shattered her heart? She does everything with him except eat out and says she\\'s not emotionally involved. And yet as a reader you can see that\\'s a bald faced lie.This just made the book drag on and left me feeling dissatisfied because I didn\\'t feel the hero groveled much at all.Tranquilamente un 2.5Si tuviera que definir este libro en una sola palabra, sin duda sería: aburrido.

How to write this review without the whole thing turning into a Hardy Cates droolfest. It\\'s going to be very hard, because I love the man!One Upon a Time, There was a Guy Named Hardy Cates...:I met Hardy Cates in Sugar Daddy, and I have to say that I sure did fall hard for him. Big time! Hard as a young Liberty Jones did. I could see that beneath that mind-numbingly sexy bad boy veneer was a sensitive, loving, good-hearted person. My feelings never changed for him.As much as I loved Sugar Daddy, I truly did take exception with the fact that my beloved author Lisa Kleypas was taking a shortcut to her happy ending by making Hardy seem like a bad guy so Liberty would have a reason to choose Gage. I don\\'t think Hardy deserved that. Am I putting him on a pedestal? Nope. But Hardy could have been the guy who didn\\'t win Liberty simply because the older Liberty knew that Gage was the man she wanted. Not because of the dirty trick he pulled. I was so disappointed with that! Naturally, I was exceedingly thrilled to see Hardy get his day in the sun in this book. And boy does he shine.Oh, No! Danielle\\'s Reading a Chick Lit Book! Not Again!:Although this book is still a lot more chick lit-oriented than I normally would prefer, I found myself taking it in with an effervescent fervor that I found surprising. Although maybe that\\'s not surprising at all in the sense that I never doubted Lisa Kleypas\\' ability to write a beautiful, enjoyable book. I am familiar with LK\\'s experimental spirit that causes her to try different elements in her stories, and I admire her for that. And for this chick-lit non-fan, she did a bang up job. This is a nicely-done hybrid of chick lit and romance and it\\'s successful on both counts.There is much time spent on Haven\\'s life apart from Hardy. Not too much, thankfully, but necessary all the same. Page time is spent on a marriage that turns out to be nightmare for Haven. As I read about Haven\\'s marriage, I felt this strange kinship with her. I\\'ve never been married, nor have I been in a bad relationship like her. But I have been in situations where I felt like the intrinsic person I was didn\\'t seem valued, like I was being absorbed and eaten away until nothing remained. I loved how visually this is illustrated with Haven\\'s dream about being a Barbie doll whose body parts slowly fall off until nothing is left. That feeling is so real for people who have been in those toxic relationships where your identity is nothing but a reflection of that other person\\'s. A sounding board for their brilliance, glamor, perfection. For what I call \\'go with the flow\\' people who don\\'t need to be the center of attention, and who often sacrifice their own needs for others\\', because they attract the emotional energy suckers like a vacuum. I wanted to cry bitter tears for Haven. And I did cry. I cannot get over how traumatic it was to read about the abuse that she suffered at the hands of her husband. How he took everything of value from her, and it wasn\\'t enough. I yelled at Haven to get out, to say no. I wished that she had ran off with Hardy that night of Liberty and Gage\\'s wedding. Unfortunately, she didn\\'t. On the other hand, how can we skip through the bad parts of life that help us to be who we were meant to become, that make us strong, so we can get to the good parts? Life doesn\\'t work that way. Would Hardy and Haven have lasted (as the people they were then) if they started their happy ending that night, or is their love stronger for what they experienced in the two years apart? I think the latter. Unlike my so savvy romance reviewing sisters on here, I didn\\'t mark quotes, but I loved what Haven thinks about herself and Hardy together. That their respective broken areas make them fit together so much better. I truly believed that to be the case.Haven:Haven was a beautifully layered character. She might have come off as the spoiled little rich girl, if not done so well. I didn\\'t get that from her. I did see her insecurities and her desire to be loved, feel worthy, and special. I hurt for her that this led her into such a terrible situation with her husband. I hurt for her that she didn\\'t get the love that she needed from her mother or father. Their version of love worked okay for her brothers, but it didn\\'t really satisfy the little girl who had never felt valued by her parents. I could identify with Haven\\'s tendency to want to make others happy, often at her own expense. I loved seeing her grow as a person. I loved her for her having the courage to confront some truly scary situations and take control of her life from the fear that held her back and caged her. She was a wonderful heroine. Liberty is a hard act to follow, but I think Haven did a really great job of claiming her own place in my heart as a heroine.Back to Hardy:Oh, what a man. Once again, Ms. Kleypas hits the mark in crafting her characteristic self-made hero. There is something so enduring, so distinct about Hardy\\'s essence. He shows up the oh-so prevalent stereotypes about trailer park/small town/good ol\\' boy guys (I won\\'t use the less nice terms). What others might consider unworthy, I can\\'t help but love about him. He\\'s down to earth, honest, real, vital, and not afraid to be a rough, real guy. That appeals to me big time, even if I didn\\'t think I would necessarily go for that type of guy. A man who came from nothing, and pulled himself up painfully. A man with an inner drive and ambition that actually embarassed him. Like Haven, I totally didn\\'t think he needed to feel shame about that. A person cannot choose where they come from, but they can choose what kind of person they will be in the future. Hardy chose to be about something. He had a reputation for being twisted,and what he did to Gage in Sugar Daddy was wrong,but I felt that Hardy had honor. He was a man that would fight and work for what he valued. And he treats women with respect and consideration. That\\'s really important to me as a person. Although I think Hardy is one of the most physically sexiest heroes ever written, I also love his capacity for gentleness, how he loves all of Haven and values everything that she is. Haven thought that Hardy just wanted to use her to get back at her family. But I never saw it that way. Hardy wanted Haven for the unique person she was, that drew him to her like a moth to a flame, and he showed how much she meant to him through his actions. Deep down I think she believed that about him.The fact that she calls him when she\\'s stuck in the elevator when she could only call one person is very telling.Even when he didn\\'t always do things the right way or say all the fancy words, he showed it. And I was glad that Haven could see that there was something of value to Hardy even though everyone warned her away from him. I have to tell you, I am not saying this lightly. Hardy is one of my favorite heroes of all time. He\\'s definitely going in my top ten list, and near the top five, I think. And that\\'s an honor. I don\\'t know how you did it, Ms. Kleypas, but you hit solid gold here.Overall Thoughts:Blue-Eyed Devil is a book that came to mean so much to me, despite its brevity. There is so much in this book that calls to my book-loving soul. Lisa Kleypas writes so beautifully. She\\'s a very funny, and insightful person when it comes to human nature. The way in which she shows the interactions between people is very true to life. Although I love her historicals, I do feel that she has convinced me of her skill as a contemporary writer. She shows me what there is to be appreciated about the present, when I tend to be more captivated by the past and the fantasy worlds, which seem so much more tantalizing. The conversations and the confrontations that the characters have in this book are real to me. I often felt like I had been there, both in situations with my family, friends, and with co-workers or bosses. That as much as the soul-stirring, heart-melting romance won me over in this book. I loved Sugar Daddy, but I have to say that I loved Blue-Eyed Devil even more. I give this book the highest recommendation. You might not like it, and that\\'s okay. But I love it enough that I wish you\\'d give it a try.\"Haven, you know I\\'m right. Let\\'s talk about this.\"\"If you don\\'t want to have sex, I don\\'t want to talk about our feelings.\"He scrubbed his hand through his hair, looking confused. \"Well, that\\'s for damn sure the first time a woman\\'s ever said that to me.\"\"I don\\'t take rejection well,\" I muttered.\"It\\'s not rejection, it\\'s a postponement. And if Jack Daniel\\'s makes you this ornery, I\\'m never pouring you another shot.\"\"It has nothing to do with the whiskey. I\\'m this ornery all on my own.\"\"Hardy,\" I said tentatively, \"would you…indulge me a little?\"A smile touched his mouth. He reached out and pulled the sides of the shirt closed, an used the backs of his fingers to stroke my cheek. \"A little,\" he said, \"or a lot. Just tell me what you want.\"After readingBrown-Eyed Girl, I feel I should be doing a reread of Blue-Eyed Devil.Will be editing my review.4 starsI read the first book in this series ‘Sugar Daddy’ earlier last year and it was my first Lisa Kleypas book. I loved it and couldn’t wait to get more of the Travis family. Unfortunately, the audio books for the rest of the series were unavailable. When I saw thatBlue-Eyed Devilwas on audio, I jumped at reading it!Haven Travis is the only girl in the Travis clan and she’s trying to make her own path. She’s in love and marries a man her family doesn’t want her to, and it doesn’t go as planned. The man she marries is not a good guy and she ends up coming back to her family, but she’s sworn off men for now.Then there is Hardy Cates. I was curious about Hardy in the first book of this series and I loved him with Haven. It takes a while for them to find their groove and for her to open up to a man again, but Hardy breaks her barriers down. These two had such strong chemistry and a great connection. I adored them together.Blue-Eyed Devilwas another Kleypas win for me. I’m looking forward to reading the last two Travis books and more from this author in the future!\"I love you enough to try and deserve you. I would do anything, be anything, for you.”Lisa Kleypas escribe bien, yo creo que nadie puede poner eso en duda, pero hay veces en que realmente crea historias memorables y, a mi gusto, la de Heaven Travis es una de ellas.Después deMi Nombre es Liberty, que considero un inicio un poco flojo para esta serie, la dejé en pausa por un buen tiempo hasta que volví a darle una oportunidad a la Kleypas contemporánea… y de lo único que me arrepiento es de no haber leído antes este segundo libro.Al igual que en la primera entrega, esta novela se puede dividir en dos momentos: primero, el matrimonio de Heaven con Nick, que se desarrolla en una espiral de abusos que vain crescendoa través del tiempo, hasta llegar al punto de quiebre. Aquí la autora hace un trabajo de lujo, pues logra que el lector se involucre en la relación; yo no podía dejar de leer y realmente se me estrujó en corazón mientras avanzaba la historia. Y todo sin abusar de recursos efectistas, por el contrario, la delicadeza con la que abordó la situación, siempre desde la mirada de la anulación de la personalidad y dignidad de una mujer sometida a violencia física y psicológica entre las cuatro paredes de un matrimonio, realmente me conmovió.La segunda parte se concentra en el proceso de recuperación de Heaven y aquí entra en escena Hardy Cates, sí, el mismo que no se portó muy bien en el primer libro. Sin embargo, aquí, se gradúa con honores, a pesar de ese lado oscuro que siempre lo acompaña.Los hermanos Travis siguen teniendo un papel bastante protagónico, y la autora supo cómo introducirlos: al principio Gage, a quien ya conocemos, pero hacia el final, Jack, que nos abre el apetito para la siguiente entrega, la que por supuesto leeré sin dejar pasar tanto tiempo.Reto #21 PopSugar 2018: Un libro con tu color favorito en el títuloI\\'ve been in a massive book hangover this week and I couldn\\'t read anything new.

He\\'s gorgeous, rich, charming with enough vulnerability to make you fall in love with his character. He\\'s strong and heroic and there\\'s no doubt to his love and devotion for Haven.Haven Travis...Despite growing up rich and privileged, Haven\\'s life is far from perfect. She made a really bad decision of marrying Nick who ended up abusing her physically and emotionally. My heart went out to her. I was kind of mad at her father for being so overbearing towards her. I honestly didn\\'t feel that he loves her at all. Her dad had more time and love for Liberty and Carrington than Haven and that really upset me because she tried so hard to become the daughter he wants. I loved how her character evolved from being a frightened young woman to become a force in her own right.I loved all the side characters; Gage, Liberty, Jack, Joe...and Todd.

And sinceTHISbook is apparently never ever ever gonna happen, I decided to re-read this series for the zillionth time.Original Review:5 Thousand One Million Stars. All of them.One of my favorite Highlander romance series of ALL TIME.All the time.I have read and re-read this entire series so many times since it first came out that it\\'s stupid. LOVE it.When she was his wife, he\\'d take great delight in advising her of her duty to him and, most important, her obligation to obey him without question.Sigh. What a disappointment. I was so eager to read this book because I adored (ADORED) Banks\\' \"Montgomerys and Armstrongs\" trilogy,Never Seduce a ScotandHighlander Most Wanted. I loved Banks\\' kind, honorable, compassionate, and patient heroes. So I dived into In Bed With A Highlander expecting a real treat.Instead I got stuff like this:Misogynistic views, such as:\"She said nothing the entire time she was with you? Let nothing slip? Think, Alaric. She had to have said something. It simply isn\\'t a woman\\'s nature to be silent for prolonged periods of time.\"And\"There\\'ll be plenty of time to see her face. Besides, \\'tis not the face you need to concern yourself with. \\'Tis the rest.\"Really? This is our hero? Are you serious? And I\\'m not talking about early in the book, okay, in case you are thinking, \"Oh, he just needs to be reformed.\" No. That second quote is from the 62% mark! By that time, even an \"asshole hero\" should know better....We also have a complete obsession on the hero\\'s part in re: the heroine\\'s obedience - and I\\'m NOT talking about in bed.\"You WILL obey me.\"and\"I am your laird, and you will obey me as everyone else here obeys me. Is that understood?\"and\"When I issue a summons, I expect you to heed it,\" he said. \"I expect - nay, I DEMAND - obedience. I won\\'t accept defiance from you.\"Ew, really? Ugh. He also likes shutting her up, mostly by kissing her - but sometimes with hand-gagging:When she would have opened her mouth to dispute his assertion, he shocked her by clamping his hand over her mouth.\"You will be silent and allow me to finish.\"Unless you are enjoying a sexual game (which they were NOT), you just do not treat another person like this and disrespect them in that way. It\\'s wrong. The fact that he just wants his wife to shut up all the time and has no desire to listen to what she wants to tell him is bad enough, hand-gagging her is atrocious. I can\\'t forgive this....Then there\\'s all this possessive crap.Lord, but she was sweet. Nay, bedding her would be no hardship at all. The image of her swollen with his child flickered through his mind, and he found himself very pleased with the image. Very pleased indeed.Ew, ew, ew.He was hard and aching. Want was fierce within him. There was nothing to prevent him from charging across the room, yanking her from the tub and laying her on the bed. She was his to take. From the moment she\\'d set foot on his lands, she was his. Whether she wanted him or not.Okay, two things. One: peeping Toms are disgusting. Not only is what you are doing (watching her bathe without her knowledge or permission) dishonorable, but it is very creepy, skeevy, and revolting. No one likes a peeping Tom.Two: Really? All women who \"set foot on\" your land are your property to do with what you wish? Really? And you\\'re the laird of the clan? I can\\'t believe anyone would let you lead if that is your attitude. You don\\'t sound like a very good leader. You\\'re just okay with raping someone? Really? You think raping people is your \"right?\" I can\\'t even with this....Mairin is a virgin and he \"deflowers\" (hate that term) her in the most brutal way. (Keep in mind that she was badly beaten two or three days earlier.) I mean he just rips her wedding gown to shreds and plows into her. It takes two minutes and there was zero kissing, foreplay, anything. Ugh. Could you be more disgusting? I don\\'t think so. He leaves her bleeding and sobbing on the bed. Do you expect me to forgive him for this shit?!?!?!? NO. I never forgave him. He didn\\'t even feel guilty or bad about it!!!He finally starts caring that he might have hurt her or \\'done the wrong thing\\' when she starts sleeping with his 6-year-old son in her bed to keep him away from her at night. He confronts her about it and she says,\"\\'Tis truth you\\'ve no skill at loving... \\'Tis a well-known fact that a man is either skilled in matters of loving or matters of war. \\'Tis obvious that fighting is your skill.\"Ewan winced. The little wench was shredding his manhood. His cock positively withered under her criticism.THAT\\'S when he decides that kissing and foreplay and good sex is worth his time, because he has to prove his manhood and he\\'s insulted that she thinks he\\'s bad in bed. Not, you know, because he should be loving and affectionate to his wife and care about whether she\\'s enjoying herself or not. Good gravy, I can\\'t BELIEVE that this guy is supposed to be the hero. He\\'s a cretin....Is this book bad? Well, it\\'s bad for ME. I hate bossy, demanding, possessive, ruthless heroes. I HATE THEM. I know they are super-popular right now, though, labeled as \"alpha\" and many readers swoon over them. So. If reading my quotes in this review and my status updates makes you excited instead of making you want to vomit -go for it! It\\'s well-written for a romance book and Banks certainly knows how to make a book exciting and pull on your heartstrings. I think she was kind of going for a Julie Garwood-type of thing in this book - ditzy heroine who is \\'cute and feisty, but like a kitten\\' and domineering hero who wants a slave, not a wife. You know the type of book. (Not dissing Garwood - she was my first romance novel ever!)If this kind of thing floats your boat - go for it! Banks is not a bad romance writer.If, however, you like men who are patient and merciful and into things like kissing, I would absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend Banks\\' other books,Highlander Most WantedandNever Seduce a Scot. They are sweet, charming, and heartrending. Skip this drivel and go for the good stuff!ONE REAL STAR, ONE ROMANCE STARP.S. If you want to know what the actual plot is, Tessa Dare made THE CUTEST book trailer for this book - using Barbies and My Little Ponies! See it here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vn67JJ...Thanks to KarenF for letting me know about this!4 to 4 1/2 SHINING STARS!!!I\\'m going to make this review short and to the point.I...LOVED...THIS...BOOK!!!This story was fantastic. The writing was superb and the plot marvelously creative. The characters were multi-layered, endearing, and wonderfully human. Unlike some of Banks\\'s other books, the sex scenes were tastefully written and only moderately graphic.I love when authors include delightfully written children within the plot, and I found myself eagerly looking forward to the interactions between eight-year-old Crispen and Mairin, the heroine. Those endearing scenes became some of my favorites. I can not end this review without giving BIG kudos to Maya Banks. Typically, her main characters actuallycommunicateand work together as a team. A quality sadly lacking in many romance novels. It was refreshing to read!!!Why did I wait so long to read one of Maya Banks\\'s historical romances? That\\'s a good question...they\\'re simply fabulous.4.5this was exactly what i wanted!!! it gave me so much outlander vibes*** 4 1/2 stars ***In Bed with a Highlander was a great surprise! I really enjoyed reading this sweet and sexy Highland romance.Mairin has spent years at a nunnery because she is the illegitimate daughter of the former King of Scotland and has a generous dowry that would tempt men to force her into marriage. She is abducted from the nunnery by bad men loyal to Duncan Cameron, who tries to get her to marry him then beats her when she refuses to say her vows. Along the trip to Cameron lands, her kidnappers find a young boy who she takes under her wing. She escapes the Cameron holding along with young Crispin McCabe, who she helped to save from Cameron. The boy\\'s family finds them, as they were out looking for the missing Crispin, and bring them to McCabe land where Mairin meets the intimidating Laird, Ewan McCabe who is the father of Crispin.Ewan McCabe is intrigued by the beautiful Mairin, who refuses to give her name or any information. But Ewan is a smart stubborn man and eventually figures out who she is. He proposes that she marry him because he is able to keep her safe from men like Cameron and can offer her a home and family. In return his clan will get her badly needed dowry. So their marriage starts out as a convenience but these two quickly start having deeper feelings for each other. Ewan enjoys his new wife\\'s happy personality, though her impulsiveness gives him some heartburn. Mairin loves finally having a home, while Ewan\\'s protective but caring actions help her fall for him.This was a really enjoyable romance! The tone really reminded me of Julie Garwood\\'s The Secret, Ransom and Honor\\'s Splendour, so if you are a fan of those I highly recommend it. I like the fact that there were no big misunderstandings or hurtful behavior, just a good love story about two people who appreciate each other. The story was really good, it really held my attention. I love that the heroine was a nice person, but she also would stand up for herself. Ewan was a good alpha hero who learned that it was okay to show softer feeling for his beloved wife. I loved seeing the progression of their feelings as they slowly fell for each other. The ending was really sweet, but I wanted an epilogue! The younger two McCabe brothers will be having their own stories soon and I am excited for them! For those afraid of this book because it\\'s by Maya Banks, I would say it\\'s nothing like her romantica books. The steam level is normal for mass market paperback - but still nice. I like her writing much better in this (and the KGI books) than her romantica, so give it a shot even if you don\\'t like those.Highly recommended if you enjoy a good medieval Scottish romance!!'}, {'title': 'Never After #2Scarred', 'author': 'Emily McIntire', 'summary': \"She doesn't belong to him...she belongs to the crown.

But the line between hatred and passion has never seemed so thin, and as secrets come to light, Sara grows unsure of whom she can trust—torn between vengeance and the villain she was never supposed to love.   Scarred is a DARK Royal Romance and a complete standalone within The Never After Series (A series of fractured fairy tales inspired by our favorite villains). It is not a retelling or fantasy. It contains subject matter which may be triggering for some.

My heart sputters. “I’m no one’s queen. I’m just the one who will burn the crown.”– the “B.” actually stands for boredom, bothersome & brat.»»»Tristan Faasa(H) «««“If you want a god to worship, ma petite menteuse, no need to look so far.”“You thirst for power?” he rasps, his palm ghosting across my collarbone before wrapping around my throat. “I can fill you with it until you scream.”“I’ve killed many men,” he whispers against me. “And I remember the face of every single one, soaking their image into my brain as they pray to me for absolution.”– the god-complex Tristan has is getting out of hand...someone call help something is not right with that man's head, he got bullied too hard by his bigger brother when he was a kid and now he feels the need to compensate. 🤡P.S. When Tristan drew a fucking heart on Sara B.’s thigh and wrote ‘Tristan’s property’ and Sarah B. actually getting that shit tattooed? They made me wish romance was dead.it was perfect. perfect, perfect, perfect. everything down to the last minute detail.after reading the atrocity that was “hooked” i didn’t have much hope for the rest of this series. but THIS?!? what the hell was in it?!? what opioid ?!! what drug ?!? this was pure and unadulterated CRACK!!a few things i love: men that get jealous, strong and independent women, and unhinged scenes. and fuck yeah we got all of that in here. TRISTAN!!! the way this man gets FERAL over her?!? even when she’s not even his yet!!! this man was pathetic, miserable, tears in his eyes WHILE on his KNEES for her!!! no wonder this is a lion king retelling because this man was animalistic!! i’m fr about to do a line off this man’s stomach.and Sara!! literally the baddest bitch in this story. the way she has Tristan wrapped around her little finger and she doesn’t even know it?!? she could ask him to walk into a burning building and he WOULD!! their chemistry had me giddy and drawing hearts in my book!!the demonic possession this book has over me should be studied !!! not even a guillotine can separate me from the head i’m about to give- anyways…i’m convinced it doesn’t get any better than this but we shall see ☝🏽4.75 ⭐️✨ listen — I loved hooked so much. but this? this was a masterpiece. The LION KING VIBES THIS GAVE? excuse me??? I never knew I needed a Mufasa love story until I got my hands on this book. Tristan mf Fassa was EVERYTHING, literally the embodiment of “i’ll burn the world down for you” !!!!!!! & Sara? if you’re like me and you need a STRONG FEMALE MC, then look no further because ms. queen right here has GOT you. i’m also a whore for slowburn so this really did it for me. even the side characters were amazing.. paul, timothy, sheina, AND SIMON?? i’m obsessed. the epilogue was to die for, specially the last couple sentences — the way I teared up? sos. the only reason why I didn’t give this a full 5 star was because I wanted a lil bit more emotional connection between the love interests throughout the book, but honestly it’s not even that deep, I clearly loved it regardless. i’m on my knees for tristan, did I mention that?“The truth is, I am yours. Wholly. Inexplicably. Painfully. Unconditionally. And if you need to sacrifice my soul so you’re able to live with yours, then do it.”If someone were to tattoo “property of …” onto my thigh, I would have them arrested.Also when he just left after she said that it would be a lie to say no one had ever touched her, I LAUGHED. What a petty man.Here are some quotes from this beautiful and totally not disturbing book: trigger warnings for mention of SA below1. “my self-discipline disintegrates when I picture her blood coating the length of my dick, proving she’s mine and no one else’s”CALLING THE POLICE RIGHT NOW2. “maybe she’s already forgotten that I threatened to let the town r*pe her while I killed everyone she loved.”3. “It’s a heart. Not the kind that you see kids draw or the type that you would expect in paintings that depict love. This one is of the organ, blood dripping off its edges, and vessels running through the muscle. A thick chain wraps around its center and coils beneath it, a padlock on the end. I squint my eyes and look closer, realizing there’s writing on the lock.Tristan’s Property.”A crime against the art of tattooingI was warned — I was told that this book would fall short, but I heed no mind. And now that I am disappointed, who am I to blame? Because as much as Hooked wasn't perfect, I enjoyed them, but Scarred feels like reading an entirely different work.A thing that I love about McIntire's book is the disclaimer at the very beginning of the book because it helps the reader to lay the groundwork of the book's direction. So did I delve into the book with no expectation whatsoever since the author did say this will be a slow burn. However, as soon as I did, I realized that:i) Era-themed is not my cup of tea if weren't done right— I think the reason why Hooked was an easy read was that it was set in a contemporary setting.ii) Scarred is too slow for my liking— put an era-themed book with a deliberate build-up; better watch the paint dry anyway.iii) The dialogue in this book is so calculated— it feels unnatural, consequently making some of the moments in the book sound just corny. I cannot take anything seriously, I'm sorry.This also then makes me question if the only reason I enjoyed Hooked was because I was thrilled by the stamp of it being a Peterpan retelling, and everyone who knows me knows I am obsessed with Peterpan. Because not only this book has a predictable and boring storyline, the characters (even the H/h) are the blandest ones I've come to know.The forbidden love sounds so promising and slow-burn supposed to serve as a wherein plot, methodically toward an explosive boiling point. Sadly, nothing was burning and there wasn't even tension between Sara and Tristan. I literally roamed through the book after the 30% mark because I couldn't find myself staying on a single page that long without falling asleep.I was surprised to see that many had enjoyed this (like, why am I not on board with this). Maybe we were having a different prospect of what the book should be, I don't know; to each of their own. As for myself, I should've taken the warning seriously next time.\"}, {'title': 'House of Night #1Marked', 'author': 'P.C.

(But then again, just don\\'t read this book.)Warning: This review is just me being verynegative. In no way will this review sound intelligent and well written. Therefore, if you wish to continue, you may.Anyway, I will start all the way from the beginning. There are so many things I\\'d like to point out.I pick up the book. I see the cover. It\\'s a picture of half a girl\\'s face. I\\'m guessing that\\'s Zoey. Whatever. I look at the back. There is a comment from Gena Showalter on the top that says:\"From the moment I stuck my face in this book it hooked me! Totally awesome new take on vampires! Marked is hot and dark and funny. It rocks!\"First of all, what kind of author talks like that? Or is she just as idiotic as the Casts? Or maybe she really did like it. Or maybe the Casts \"made her write that.\" Confused? You\\'ll see what I\\'m talking about shortly. There is also a dreadfully long summary of the whole damn book on the back. Way to give away almost everything.The Characters:Let\\'s start with the protagonist herself, Zoey Redbird.I found someone whinier than Bella Swan. Someone more stupid than Bella Swan. Someone more clumsy than Bella Swan.Specific evidence of Zoey\\'s stupidity:- Page 1: \"If I died, would it get me out of my geometry test tomorrow? One could only hope.\"Oh, that\\'s completely understandable. I mean, I feel dumb for thinking about whether I left a lasting legacy. I should be thinking about minuscule matters such as school tests. Silly me.- Page 46: \"She wasn\\'t thin like the freak girls who puked and starved themselves into what they thought was Paris Hilton chic. (\"That\\'s hott.\" Yeah, okay, whatever, Paris.\")Freak girls? Because anorexia and bulimia are not serious issues at all...Page 100: \"Cereal?\" I suddenly perked up. I seriously adore cereal, and have an I heart Cereal shirt somewhere to prove it.\"Do I need to even explain what\\'s wrong with that?Page 188: \"Can I ask you something? It\\'s kinda personal,\" Erik said. \"Hey you\\'ve seen me drink blood from a cup and like it, puke, kiss a guy, lick his blood like I\\'m a puppy, and then bawl my eyes out. And I\\'ve seen you turn down a blow job. I think I can manage to answer a kinda personal question.\"What.Page 277: \"Aphrodite laughed a throaty, I\\'m-so-grown-up-and-you\\'re-just-a-kid laugh. I really hate it when girls do that. I mean, yes, she\\'s older, but I have boobs, too.\"Yes, because only breasts signify that a girl is grown up. Great message, Casts.Also, I wanted to shoot myself with the stupid parenthetical overkill they put throughout the whole damn book.I\\'m not sure if they deliberately created Zoey for the sole reason that we should all hate her. They haveno ideahow teenagers act and talk. Apparently all teenagers say LIKE OMG! NO WAY! YEAH, WHATEVER! I HAVE BOOBS, TOO! ZOMG.Zoey is the special, one-of-a-kind, \"chosen one.\" Only she can rule the world, basically. Her mentor is the best. She has all the powers. She is the one and only. Cliche much? Very. I was just sad I was stuck inside her head for the entire book. I felt suffocated.Zoey\\'s friends are all pathetic excuses for friends. The \"twins\" are annoying little brats. Damon is just a moron. And oh yeah, the country girl. Stevie Rae is just fucking annoying.Aphrodite and Erik. I couldn\\'t stop laughing every time I read about them.AND WHO THE HELL HAS ORAL SEX IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHOOL HALLWAY?! Or am I really that naive when it comes to horny high school children?- Erik is themore stupidhotter version of Edward Cullen. He follows Zoey around. He asks her incredibly awkward/creepy questions. He\\'s just very romantic, am I right.Erik =That\\'s the ugliest thing I\\'ve seen in my entire life.- Aphrodite is just a poor excuse for an antagonist. *Googles Aphrodite* Oh! The Greek goddess of love, beauty, and sexuality! Another character whose name defines her personality. *rolls eyes*The writing:I guess editing just lost its meaning in the midst of horrible books. Where is Editing?! Where are you, my love?!I\\'m not even going to talk about the plot because there was no plot. I only read half the book (painfully), but I\\'m certain there was no plot for the parts I didn\\'t read as well.I know this is said very lightly sometimes, but this is actually the worst book I\\'ve ever read. It was so painful to accept that this was actually published.I just want to say one last, important thing to the Casts:Read about half of it. Hated it. I\\'m returning the rest to the library.The authors tried to make so many references to pop culture, they sounded ridiculous, and then were even proud of themselves for \"sounding like teenagers,\" as they stated in the preface. Dumb. They tried to make moral lessons out of the life of this \"fledgling,\" and had her reject things like Paris Hilton\\'s weight, oral sex amongst teenagers, and Ashton Kutcher unfortunately liking older women. Oh, and the world was separated into the \"vampyres\" and the religious right. Could they be more obviously parading their own moral agenda in young adult fiction? Regardless of whether you agree or disagree with the values they project in this book, they make it so plain that they are trying to jam-pack the book with certain ideals that it turns out like literary crap. If you want an awesome, captivating fantasy fiction series that gets teenage girls thinking about our over-sexualized and beautified culture, try Scott Westerfield. He\\'s a little more subtle, and thus requires some intelligent thought on what you\\'re reading.This was how the book started. The first two pages literally went like this:Tweeny 1: \"ZOMG like -insert some teeny bs gossip here-\"Tweeny 2: \"ZOMG like no! -more teeny gossip and more OMGs-\"Tweeny 1: \"ZOMG like yeah.\"All of a sudden some macho vamp guy stands in the hallway, points at teeny no #1 and is like \"ZOEY YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO BE THE MAIN CHARACTER IN A BOOK THAT IS SO NOT TRYING TO BE LIKE TWILIGHT BUT YEAH YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.\"Then they\\'re like \"ZOMG YOU HAVE BEEN CHOSEN.\"Tweeny 1: \"SNAP. I have been chosen.\"Tweeny 2: \"SNAP AND ZOMG YOU\\'RE A FREAK NOW I\\'M OUT OF HERE.\"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how the worst book I have ever read starts off. Worse than Twilight, worse than Hush, hush, and worse than Evermore (almost). This book was just one big melodramatic teen angsty bitch fit. With vampyres. And stereotypes. And a sexy hunk. And a Queen Bee arch rival. And a blowjob. And of course the main character is a complete Mary sue, once again.I first read this just as a laugh, because sometimes I want to read bad books for the lolz. But what was at first fun to make fun of then turned horrifically bad, and eventually so intolerable that I had to close it halfway. As soon as Zoey was in love with Shakespeare vampire hunk, (sorry, vampYre) I just couldn\\'t handle further stupidity. I could not believe this was written by two adults. This was like fanfiction. I have seen fanfiction which went along pretty much the same basis as this book. Heck I have seen fanfiction which was BETTER WRITTEN and BETTER OVERALL than this book.Zoey was absolutely frustrating and so easy to hate. That\\'s horridly inconvenient since she\\'s the main character, and we\\'re being told this \\'story\\' from her perspective. She whines and complains about EVERYTHING, and is an obvious attempt at a parody of a teenager by these two idiots of women authors. A pin would fall to the ground and immediately her life is oooooverrrrrr. Also according to Zoey, if you don\\'t nail your underwear and your bra to your body and if you don\\'t remain virginal in any way shape or form, whether it\\'s kissing a guy or wearing a certain amount of make up or style of clothing, you\\'re a total slut. Woooow. Zo, just because you\\'re a goddamn prude it doesn\\'t mean everyone else should be, and you shouldn\\'t try to lecture your female readers on their sexuality. Just because you\\'re ashamed of sexuality, it doesn\\'t mean that\\'s a good thing because you happened to be a main character. Also it\\'s pretty obvious you\\'re jealous you yourself can\\'t be that proud.Zoey\\'s friends were all painful stereotypes. Especially her girl friend... what\\'s her name again... I don\\'t know. My mind shut her out because she was too damn annoying. Oh wait... Steve or something. -coughs- anyway, yeah. That chick was an obvious out there comic-relief and completely uncalled for. Every time she said anything I wanted to punch her. I didn\\'t care much for her gay friend either. He was just a cliched gay. And no, I don\\'t have anything against homosexuals. That would be awfully hypocritical since I\\'m a very out of the closet homosexual myself. But this guy was boring and cliched.Then there\\'s the queen Bee arch rival. -yawn- Oh here\\'s something I haven\\'t seen before... Oh and Zoey falls in love with some vampire guy after he reads a speech from Shakespeare in his sexy vampire hunk voice. So within two seconds, Zoey is in love. True love, yada yada, he\\'s the one, he\\'s so hot, all her friends support her love, bla bla bla, gush gush gush. Then I closed the book.What a piece of overrated, stinky, shitty tripe. The writing was ridiculous, all the characters were boring and annoying and cliched to death, and the overall plot was pulled out of both authors nailed shut asshole. It was ridiculous. The whole book was bloody ridiculous. What on earth was I reading? -shudder- I can\\'t believe this book was published, let alone so well received. And don\\'t give me that \\'it\\'s an amazing booooooook and you\\'re just jealooooousssss\\' crap. Please. It\\'s an awful excuse for a book and I would rather watch 2 girls 1 cup again (from the beginning to the end this time) than have Marked by P.C Crap and Kristin Crap sitting on my shelf.Oh, I liked this book SOOOOOOOOO much better than the Stephanie Meyer series--these kids are smarter, more diverse, less whiny and far more intersting. Add to that a new version of vampirism, and it\\'s a completely winning combination. The story telling is top notch, the characters are interesting, and the book is compelling start to finish. I can\\'t wait to dive into the next in this series!And I have to admit I\\'m intrigued by the concept of a mother/daughter writing team, especially such a successful one. That\\'s an interesting story in an of itself!Okay, I\\'m going to be posting gifs on this review because this book was just too much.My overall expression after reading up to 150 pages:I wish I could give this \\'no star\\' or something of the sort. I don\\'t even know where tobeginwith this \\'book\\'. It was retched, horrible, disdainful, etc. etc. P.C. Cast as well as her daughter\\'s writing is childish. All the girls had blonde hair (auburn-blonde, strawberry-blonde, blonde, curly blonde, etc.) it\\'s irritating and the only girl, besides Zoey, that didn\\'t have blonde hair was Shaunee... and she was black.I don\\'t care if this book was completely fiction and that it didn\\'t have to be realistic, but when you write how the reason these celebrities are amazing and known is because they\\'re vamps, I\\'m going to say you\\'re an idiot. Zoey is the biggest hypocrite and I never liked her, not even for a bit. My friend told me she dated four boys at once. Wasn\\'t she shit talking girls in this book for doing stuff like that, though? I want to scream.This book had:Annoying teen girls.Ridiculous passages.Try-hard humour....Shall I continue?Offensive and ridiculous passages:\\'...One was black, with impossibly long hair (must be a really good weave)...\\'These authors see black women with short, crappy hair? And if they do have long, beautiful hair it\\'s automatically a weave? How rude.\\'...the Mark had somehow made my eyes look even bigger and darker. I lined them with a smoky black shadow that had little sparkly flecks of silver in it. Not heavily like those loser girls who think that plastering on black eyeliner makes them look cool. Yeah,right. They look like scary raccoons.\\'Loser girls? LOL, okay.\\'\"Is that a bathroom?\" I asked as we hurried past water fountains situated between two doors.\"Yep,\" she said. \"Here\\'s my class, and there\\'s yours right next door. See you after class!\"\"Okay, thanks,\" I called.At least the bathroom was close. If I had a case of raging nervous-stomach diarrhoea I wouldn\\'t have to run far.\\'Really? That very last sentence really was not needed. They could have at least wrote, \\'At least the bathroom was close in case of an immense emergency.\\' or something like that.\\'I\\'ve only had detention once so far, and that wasn\\'t my fault. Really. Some turd boy told me to suck his cock. What was I supposed to do? Cry? Giggle? Pout?Umm...no...So instead I bitch-slapped him (although I prefer just using the word smacked)...\\'If you prefer using the word \\'smacked\\' then maybe you should have done? \\'Turd boy\\'?\\'\"So, what preconceived notions do you have about Amazon warriors?\" she asked the class.A blonde who sat on the other side of the room said, \"The Amazons were heavily matriarchal, as are all vampyre societies.\"Jeesh, she sounded smart.\\'No, she just paid attention in class.\\'I had no idea an hour had passed; the ringing bell was a total surprise.

There you are!\"\"Ohmygod! Stevie Rae! You scared the poo out of me!\"\\'Lord, help these so-called \\'writers\\'. Please.I dropped the book after that. I\\'m done. Irefuseto finish this book. Everyone thinks Twilight is bad? Twilight doesn\\'t have a damn thing on this crappy excuse of a book. The writing of this \\'book\\' makes Twilight seem as though it was perfectly written (okay, I\\'m over-exaggerating a tad bit, but it\\'s still better than this. At least I read through the whole book and that\\'s saying something. Am I right, or am I right?) I mean, really, the average user rating for this is 3.83 stars? WOW. Just WOW.Let me also add that these authors think they\\'ve done an amazing job with sounding like teenagers.... riiiiight... keep telling yourselves that.'}, {'title': 'The Maddox Brothers #1Beautiful Oblivion', 'author': 'Jamie McGuire', 'summary': 'Fiercely independent Camille \"Cami\" Camlin gladly moved on from her childhood before it was over. She has held down a job since before she could drive, and moved into her own apartment after her freshman year of college.

His friends wanted to be him, and women wanted to tame him, but after a tragic accident turned his world upside down, Trenton leaves campus to come to grips with the crushing guilt. Eighteen months later, Trenton is living at home with his widower father, and works full-time at a local tattoo parlor to help with the bills. Just when he thinks his life is returning to normal, he notices Cami sitting alone at a table at The Red. As the baby sister of four rowdy brothers, Cami believes she’ll have no problem keeping her new friendship with Trenton Maddox strictly platonic. But when a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever—even if she is the only reason their already broken family could fall apart.', 'rating': '4.08', 'reviews': 'Review coming soon!5 Maddox Stars!What is it about those Maddox brothers? They are impossible not to love. Honestly, I thought that there was no way I would love Trenton like I love Travis, no way thatBeautiful Oblivioncould topBeautiful Disaster. I would say that the book was just as good, and if you can believe it… I liked Trent even more than Travis! I feel like I’m betraying Travis by saying that, but I can’t help it. I’ve fallen in love with a different Maddox boy ♥Cami knows from the moment she becomes ‘friends’ with Trenton Maddox, she is in trouble. Maddox boys scream trouble. Guys want to be them and women flock to them. All but Cami. She’s always stayed away from the Maddox boys. Growing up with four brothers, she knows how guys like that are. Trent notices Cami at The Red Door and insists they become friends. He won’t let her say no.How is it possible to stay just friends with someone like Trent? Tatted up and gorgeous, and super sweet to boot. He makes it very difficult. The more time Cami and Trent spend together, the closer they become. He’s not just a friend to her, he’s one of her very best friends.Can these two stay just friends without crossing the line? Will the secret Cami’s been keeping ever come to the surface? There is so much more to the story line I am keeping to myself because this is one story you won’t want spoiled. Even most of the quotes I wanted to post in my review seemed a little too spoilerish. So you’re just going to have to read it for yourself! Be prepared to devour this book. Once you start it, you won’t want to put it down. It’s one of those books, just like BD that you could easily read cover to cover because you get lost in the story.Trent Maddox. Different from Travis, but just as wonderful. I think he is the most caring, thoughtful and sweet Maddox brother. And a new favorite book boyfriend of mine. He was tattooed male perfection. And the old saying is absolutely true. When a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever. Cami was one of those heroines who never annoyed me. I loved how independent she was. She was loyal, level headed and strong. They worked well together. You will also get to meet a few new faces. This book has some awesome secondary characters!Beautiful Obliviontakes place right beforeBeautiful Disasterand runs parallel to Travis and Abby’s story. It was fun to get those snippets of Travis in there. It makes me want to go back and re-read BD! And how this story ended… lets just say I am even more excited for the next Maddox brother’s book!Jamie McGuire’s writing is addictive. Just try to stop reading this book once you’ve started- it’s near impossible!Beautiful Oblivionis a wonderful freinds to lovers romance. Engaging, sexy, witty, ansty and fun. It’s going to be one that goes on my favorites list! I would recommend this one to ALL Beautfiul Distaster fans. You won’t be dissapointed!“No one has ever wanted anyone as much as I want you.”A HUGE thanks to ATRIA BOOKS for giving Book Babes Unite an ARC of this spectacular book!1.5/2\"I have a bad case of awkward as fuck.\"Stars.I really do not know where to start... I am beyond disappointed....As such my review is going to be short and too the point.For me, there were one too many similarities to Beautiful Disaster, for the key development points to Cami and Trent\\'s relationship, as well as Cami\\'s whole back-story.There was far too much extra drama from secondary characters, the whole Raegan/Kody/Jason Hoopla added absolutely nothing to the story, and just got on my nerves. Also for some reason, (and at this point I am guessing that it is possibly due to it theoretically being the beginning of a new series) Jamie felt the need to give us a full life story of pretty much every secondary character. I didn\\'t as a reader feel the story needed this information and all it did was clog up the flow. Trent and Cami were actually like secondary characters at points.Although I didn\\'t realise it until the very end, I worked out the twist within the first few pages, it was only when the \\'BIG\\' reveal is given that it really clicked. Total \\'ick\\' moment for me, hated it. As I like to keep things spoiler free that\\'s all I am going to say. I haven\\'t read A Beautiful Wedding (feeling like I have dodged a huge bullet about that now too), and as such now knowing Abby\\'s reasoning behind marrying Travis was just another drop of salt into my already festering wound of disappointment.I have no doubt people will read and love this book in their masses, I really wanted to be one of those people. The fact this book has gotten any stars from me at all is all down to a certain Travis Maddox, we get too see a little more of him on his visits to Red, and Cami\\'s conversations with him, while he is negotiating his way through what is essentially Beautiful Disaster, gave us more insight into what he went through, and his interactions with Trent at points too were just enough to keep me reading.ARC generously provided via Netgalley, in exchange for the above honest review. I hate that I didn\\'t love this book.2 starsNo! just no.I\\'m gonna keep this as simple as i can.It was shitty, Boring, unnecessarily book/money machine of a book.I\\'m not the only one who thinks that, mostly everyone does as well.Jamie McGuire is so not a good writer:● She hit the jackpot when she created Travis Maddix and that is THE ONLY good thing she ever wrote about. Just creating this character. Because as we know (the real fans) she screwed alot with that book because she wrote a hundred novellas (hyperbole).● Jamie McGuire stop. You did good with Travis and that\\'s it. Stop writing about it. Stop re-candling all the glory girl!● The best thing aboutBeautiful Oblivionis the cover.● I read all of Jamie\\'s books, so before you start saying ohhh you haven\\'t read her other books I HAVE, they suck ass.● The reason why i\\'m so pissed as F is because i LOVE Beautiful Disaster. I read all of Jamie\\'s books. so,I really can now say with absolute certainty that creating Travis was just a coincidence.And that is fine, but stop ruining this awesome book to the fans and stop saying that \" the fans wanted more of Travis and his brothers blah blah blah\" because as a fan i know that i don\\'t want this DISASTER. HA get it ? ;)Not gonna say much about this book because. Where is it? There is no clear plot, boring characters. tons of unresolved issues.It\\'s either that or my copy has 50 chapters deleted.I think not.It\\'s strange because did her publisher told her \"Jamie, girlfriend FU*KING STOP. Or more like, that ain\\'t gonna work honey\"?!Hmmm Maybe not! O.oIt\\'s strange to think of these people as professionals sometimes.What do you guys think? Let\\'s discuss it together :)Tiny disclaimer, this isn\\'t a hate review. I\\'m just a passionate personwith anger problems,and a potty mouth ;)THREE MADDOX STARS.“I was in trouble. Big, disastrous, Maddox trouble.”I was beyond excited to start this most anticipated book, it feels like so long ago when Jamie McGuire announced that she would be writing a series involving the Maddox brothers and since then I\\'ve been more than ready to fall in love once again with one of this authors beautifully damaged heroes. \\'Beautiful oblivion\\' is a complicated love story with plenty of swoon and sexy to go with it. It didn\\'t quite reach my five star rating but I still felt like I enjoyed my Maddox fix, here\\'s to authors we love and characters that we can\\'t help but adore.What\\'s it all about?Camille Camlin doesn\\'t need any more complications in her life she already has to contend with a broken family, living independently and a boyfriend who rarely has time for her anymore. When Trent Maddox crashes into her life with no apologies but only a determined effort to stick by her side, Cami has no choice but to allow a friendship to develop. Trenton Maddox has always had a soft spot for the fiery independent Cami and he\\'s ready to make his move and if all she is offering is friendship then he will work on the rest. They both believe that they can maintain a platonic friendship but this Maddox brother had fallen hard and fast and Cami soon realises that she may not be able to live without this determined brother in her life.What did I love?Jamie McGuire is undoubtably the queen of the New Adult romance genre. She creates stories and characters that stick with me long after I\\'ve finished with her books. \\'Beatiful oblivion\\' aside from anything else about it has delivered yet another perfect Maddox brother and although the story overall may not have won me over entirely this Maddox brother certainly has. Unlike so many new adult books I found myself amused by the heroines antics, she was independent, fiery and gave as good as she got. Her decisions were sometimes a little off centre but overall I liked her sassy nature. It was also impressive to see the story played out in the same time line as the \\'Beautiful\\' series, it made me smile as the author introduced snippets of those characters into this story and I can admit I felt nostalgic over my first love with a Maddox brother. The attraction, lust and friendship was believable between the couple and I also appreciated that the \\'L\\' word wasn\\'t thrown around too soon in the books development. Overall this was a truthfully enjoyable Maddox experience that at times made my heart pound and smile. It also had those tug at your heart moments that can only be achieved through a love of an authors characters. I\\'ll always be looking forward to this authors releases and I\\'m hoping future Maddox books will reach that full out five star standard.Why not five?Let me start off by giving a reminder that a three star rating from myself means it was likeable but not quite loveable. \\'Beautiful oblivion\\' had a very tempting hero and I can admit that at least one of my three stars is dedicated all to Trent himself, he definitely was the star of the show and once again Jamie McGuire proved that she can create characters for her fan base to fall straight into love with. Like all best selling authors there is a great expectation for readers to fall in love with their books especially if you\\'ve loved the authors previous work and although \\'Beautiful oblivion\\' had it\\'s moments where I loved it overall the storyline didn\\'t grab me in a way that I had anticipated it to instead it felt drawn out and dare I say a little boring. No doubt this author has a library full worth of talent but sadly in this instance the book didn\\'t fully agree with my tastes. However all is not lost as I can see from other reviews over Goodreads that I\\'m a little in the minority and there are plenty of five star reviews to keep true fans of Jamie McGuire happy.Final thoughts ...When you\\'ve created a book that had the abundant success that Beautiful Disaster and it\\'s companion novels had then I can\\'t imagine that it\\'s easy to respond to the hype and love with a follow up book. Jamie McGuire is an author who will always be thought of fondly by myself as the author who brought the reading community the unforgettable Travis Maddox. Similarly here this author has again created a character that certainly got the heart pounding, Travis Maddox was undeniably loveable and I doubt there will be many readers who won\\'t feel the same. Lovers of this series need to read this book to find out for themselves if it hits the McGuire spot but for me although I liked the book and have no regrets reading it, it won\\'t be a novel that I\\'ll be revisiting again. The book is now available, go grab it readers ...

Four years ago, they had a fight to end all fights, and have barely spoken since.Their once-passionate love match has been reduced to one of cold, detached politeness. But when Violet receives a letter that James has been thrown from his horse and rendered unconscious at their country estate, she races to be by his side—only to discover him alive and well at a tavern, and completely unaware of her concern. She’s outraged. He’s confused. And the distance between them has never been more apparent.Wanting to teach her estranged husband a lesson, Violet decides to feign an illness of her own. James quickly sees through it, but he decides to play along in an ever-escalating game of manipulation, featuring actors masquerading as doctors, threats of Swiss sanitariums, faux mistresses—and a lot of flirtation between a husband and wife who might not hate each other as much as they thought. Will the two be able to overcome four years of hurt or will they continue to deny the spark between them?', 'rating': '3.38', 'reviews': 'Right off the bat, this looks like it would be really cute and funny!The title, the description, and the cover ALL really sucked me in. Oh, haha! These two are going to badger each other with old-timey pranks, and won\\'t that be so different and hilarious?!I was ready to fall in love with these guys.Eh.And maybethat\\'swhy I was disappointed.The expectations were a little too high?Regardless, this one was justokfor me. It wasn\\'t funny. There wasn\\'t any snappy dialogue or witty back and forth. In fact, the heroine was kind of stupid.Violet decides to make James think she has consumption as part of a ridiculous revenge scheme after he falls off a horse. She gets the help of an aristocrat who has become an actor. <--go with it, I know it makes zero sense.He\\'s supposed to pretend he\\'s her doctor, but he leaves her husband with hisrealcard so the guy knows what is going on.Her idiotic plan ticks off her husband, so the entire book is one long unfunny joke of her coughing and him not at all fooled by it, and getting more pissed by the day. By the time she figures out that he knows what she\\'s up to, it is way past time and not at all humorous.The backstory is that after a forced marriage they fell very much in love. Then after a couple of blissful years, there was some secret falling out. And you spend the rest of the book wondering what happened.When you finallydofind out what happened, you\\'re highly annoyed with James AND Violet - mainly because her side of the story could have been easily verified by several people.It could have all been fixed with a conversation. WITH ANYONE.He\\'s just...bah. There\\'s a misunderstanding and then there\\'s that over-the-top,soap operalevel of mistrust. It doesn\\'t make sense.And the back and forth between these two at the end was very much ridiculous.She wants him to come back, then he comes back, then he doesn\\'t tell her everything, then she tells him to leave and not come back till he knows that he loves/trusts her, but he already loves/trusts her - now he\\'s gotta proooooove it. Etc., etc., etc..I mean, this isn\\'t bad. I thought it was a solid 3 star story.But it\\'s not funny and there\\'s nohoaxinghappening.Oh, I nearly forgot! But I would definitely NOT recommend the audio version. The male narrator\\'s voice sounds like a parody of a snobby British voice. There\\'s absolutelyno wayI could imagine this man as attractive in my head when all I\\'m seeing is Austin Powers.Anais Inara Chase - NarratorJoel Froomkin - NarratorThis one is fun, entertaining, quick, hilarious, feel-good reading!I know so well that:The characters were so obnoxious, immature, spoiled brats acting like underage, sabotaging their relationship over and over and at least hundred times, I want to bang their heads into each other and scream their faces to kiss and make up! But I loved their story, the hot chemistry, witty dialogues, intriguing pacing. So their childish manners can be tolerable!The couple’s silent treatment ends with faking sickness games and yes, it was quite fun but the thing I didn’t understand why the author made us too long to learn how they broke up. At least I read more than half of the book but I was still in the dark. I wanted to know how they ruined everything and their reasoning. I didn’t want to pick a side because I know both of the parties have great potential to make meaningless mistakes and at some I wanted to yell and drop the book because of way too much drama!You know what I keep reading because it is still attention worthy, making me joyful and never ending flirting waltz of the couple and amazing side characters are the best things about this book defeated the negative effects it created on my mind.So my 3.5 stars rounded up to 4. I haven’t read a historical rom-com for so long. It was interesting, exhilarating journey for me even though characters pissed me hell of more than several times.Special thanks to NetGalley and Atria Books for sharing this witty ARC with me in exchange my honest review.bloginstagramfacebooktwittermaybe it\\'s because i\\'m reading both books for a video, but this is a less funny and less interesting historical version of You Deserve Each Other.i love that there are more romances lately that focus on married couples, because it\\'s a slightly fresh take for the genre. but this didn\\'t work for me. i can get past miscommunication when it\\'s a build of misunderstanding someone\\'s feelings but this was just one poorly communicated encounter that led to the characters not talking for 4 years.and there wasn\\'t much in the way of messing with each other. the premise of this book made me think it was going to be some grand game, but there was one weak attempt at a \"hoax\" involving a fake illness and... that\\'s about it. bleh.The two main characters of this romance, Violet and James are a married couple, but have been estranged ever since they had a huge argument years ago. But after Violet gets a scare that makes her realize she may still care about her husband, she decides to play a trick on James by faking an illness, so he, too, can know what it\\'s like to worry about your estranged spouse.I absolutely loved this book. I think the emotional inner lives of the main characters were so realistic - their past hurts haunt them and control their behavior until they get a grip on that pain.I gushed about this book over onBooktube!Instagram||Twitter||Facebook||Amazon||PinterestTO HAVE AND TO HOAX gave me a veritable rollercoaster ride of reactions. When I picked this book up, I was like, \"Wow, this is so witty and well-written, I can\\'t believe it has such a low rating!\" And then I was like, \"Okay, this pranking is a little silly and I\\'mreallycurious what they were fighting about, and it\\'s more witty than ha ha funny, but I\\'m still feeling it.\" And then I was like, \"Okay, FINALLY! A kiss!\" And then I was like, \"But seriously, why are you still fighting? Literally no emotional progress has been made and we\\'re over half-way through the book.\" And then I was like, \"Three quarters of the book and I still want to shake you people and ask why your mother never taught you how to love (dee dee dee dee dee dee).\" And then I got to the end of the book and was very, very tired.This is the story of James and Violet. They were married because Violet was compromised on a balcony (ironically, with a different man-- James was only there to step in as rescuer). Since they both had an instant chemistry with witty banter, neither of them particularly minded this and it was a happy marriage-- until it wasn\\'t. After something Violet refers to as The Argument, they both basically stopped speaking to one another unless absolutely necessary, neither of them willing to cross the deep freeze of their own home because that would be a violation of the Stiff Upper Lip Act of 1386 or something. I don\\'t know.The pranking really isn\\'t as prevalent or pervasive as the summary led me to believe. The bulk of this book is the couple missing each other and arguing and dancing around the Big Misunderstanding (which made sense what I learned what it was but was still disappointing because they IMMEDIATELY repeat their mistakes after they finally talk about it and start fighting again over very similar pretenses). I buddy read this with my friendHeather, and she brought up a very good point, I thought, that a lot of what the couple has is purely physical-based. They don\\'t have much of an emotional connection, apart from an apparent fetish for bickering that easily gets out of hand and turns nasty (and no, not in a fun way). So without that trust, I guess it makes sense why jest quickly turns to emotional daggers, but at the same time, this is never really met with closure. Even James\\'s major grovel is a grand gesture DONE BEHIND VIOLET\\'S BACK which she has made it clear she has an issue with, so it\\'s like he\\'s hearing her, but he\\'s also not really hearing her if you know what I mean. What a disaster.The sex scenes in this book were quite hot and it was written with a breezy, bantery style that kind of reminded me of Tessa Dare\\'s, but the constant cheeky winks to the reader and the fact that so many of these arguments quickly became tiresome and circuitous made this a wearing read. I\\'m interested in the sequels featuring the other couples-- especially West\\'s book, I loved him-- but I wouldn\\'t read this again and I can finally understand why so many people met this with a rather lukewarm response.3 stars'}, {'title': 'Bevelstoke #3Ten Things I Love About You', 'author': 'Julia Quinn', 'summary': \"Ten Things You Should Know About This Book1.

The Hero, Sebastian, was a rake. I\\'m a sucker for a rake.2. The heroine has a great sense of humor and laughs out loud. Not in a lady-like way. I love when someone snort-laughs. It makes me laugh so much harder.3. The hero writes books that are ridiculous. One of his characters is killed by a pigeon.4. The love story is cute and awwwww-worthy.5. The grandma, although she starts out pretty shaky, turns into my favorite person by the end.Didn\\'t like:1.

They are determined to marry off their granddaughter to the Earl of Jabba. When she has the nerve to talk to our hero at the opera, they act like she has ruined herself.3. There is a lot of rumination by both characters. Over-thinking is bad enough in real life, I don\\'t want to read about someone else\\'s crazy, endless thoughts.4. Our heroine was continuing her course towards marriage to the Duke of Jabba long after he practically rapes her in a hallway. Some might call it \"selflessness\". I called it stupidity.5. THE STUPID EARL OF JABBA DOESN\\'T DIE!!!!!!Still, overall, a good story.*** 2 1/2 stars ***Ten Things I Didn\\'t Love About This Book1. Way too much internal dialogue. Plus the internal dialogue was often about completely random stuff. Show me, don\\'t tell me.2. It was boring.3. The hero came off as wimpy when he allowed the villain (his uncle) to push him around and do stuff to the heroine.4. There were a million references to the hero\\'s books, plus there were so many times where the hero would think \"If I were writing this scene...\" It was really annoying.5. The uncle was allowed to assault the heroine multiple times and he pretty much just got away with it. Ridiculous.6. There was only one short love scene. I think the descriptions of the uncle assaulting her were more graphic than the love scenes.7. The love didn\\'t seem all that passionate between the hero and heroine.8. The heroine\\'s grandmother was creepy, she didn\\'t seem to care what happened to her granddaughter.9. We were supposed to believe that only one nasty old guy was interested in the heroine? That didn\\'t seem plausible. The way her family threw that nasty old guy at her was very distasteful and hard to read.10. The book couldn\\'t quite decide whether it wanted to be funny or serious at certain points. The serious issues such as the heroine being assaulted and the hero\\'s PTSD from war were glossed over in too light of a manner.So while some parts of the book were okay and a bit humorous, the story didn\\'t work for me and I was just trying to reach the end without being too annoyed.I always enjoy Julia Quinn\\'s novels but this one was particularly good. Her characters were wonderful. Sebastian Grey is one of those book characters everyone falls in love with, and Annabel is his ideal foil.Together these two main characters give us heaps of humorous dialogue plus the development of a delightful relationship. They are perfect for each other. The story is entertaining, and the secondary characters are all well written and also given lots of amusing banter. The theme of counting to ten was used brilliantly as was the authorship of the romantic novels.In fact it was all so good that I am giving it five stars. If you are looking for an historical romance to while away a few hours this is it.Ten Things I Learned in This Book:1) Annabel\\'s family was poor2) Annabel loved her familySO3) Annabel had to marry rich to save her family.4) The Earl of Newbury was richBUT5) Annabel detested the Earl of Newbury.NEVERTHELESS6) Annabel\\'s Grandmother ordered her to marry the EarlEVEN THOUGH7) Annabel was happier with SebastianWHO8) was a handsome rogue with a great secretfrom everyone except the reader!,AND WHO9) discovered that he felt more than lust for AnnabelAND THEREFORE10) did what he had to do to keep Annabel from marrying the dukeSO THATOops!

And since I haven\\'t had the chance to listen to the entire series yet, I didn\\'t think the epilogues that I haven\\'t heard would mean anything to me.So.Once again, this is just the review of Violet\\'s novella.Now. Violet is close to my age in a lot of the books. In other words, she\\'s a middle-aged woman with a few children whothink theyare grown. So, I\\'m all like,Hell, yeah! We\\'re finally going to get a love story for a woman with stretch marks and laugh lines!I am HERE for this.Violet has mourned her husband and raised her 8 children like a boss.It\\'s. Her. Time. Now.All you baby chicks out there need to listen up. You arenotgoing to feel any older than you do right now when you\\'re a full-grown hen. I still like giggling with my girlfriends and playing with make-up. <--I just have to buy the stuff that doesn\\'t settle into myfine lines.And even when our egg-laying days are over, we still like a little cock.Which is why I latched on so hard to finally seeing Violet get some nookie.But that\\'s not what happened.This is the story of how Violet met her husband as a little girl, met him again as a young woman, got married and was happy, lost him to an unforeseeable reaction to a bee sting, and then was just satisfied with the rest of her life because she had her loving family.NOT THAT THERE\\'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.Except it wasn\\'t at all what I wanted, so I felt pretty darn unsatisfied when it was over.But whatever.“He\\'d been waiting for a love fraught with passion and drama; it hadn\\'t even occurred to him that true love might be something that was utterly comfortable and just plain easy”.Este es un libro de epílogos extra para cada uno de los ocho anteriores libros de la saga. Julia Quinn dice que escribió estos epílogos para contestar ciertas preguntas sobre las parejas que habían quedado en el aire, para explorar a fondo más aspectos olvidados o sencillamente porque tanto ella como los lectores extrañaban a los personajes. En general, los epílogos me parecieron bonitos y entretenidos, pero habría podido seguir viviendo sin leerlos, pues no se me hicieron algo tremendamente especial. Sí, hubo momentos tiernos y otros dramáticos, pero no me aportaron mucho más.Ahora, lo que sí rescato un montón de este libro es que, al final, después de todos estos segundos epílogos, Julia Quinn incluyó unanovellacorta sobre Violet Bridgerton. ¡Y me encantó leerla! Siento que, a lo largo de toda la saga, había visto a Violet sencillamente como la mamá loca que lo único que quería era que sus hijos se casaran y como la señora que los acosaba constantemente con ese tema; sin embargo, en estas páginas conocemos a una Violet mucho más joven, a una Violet que se enamora a primera vista de quien será su futuro esposo, a una Violet que disfruta de su día de bodas como la más feliz… y una Violet que queda rota cuando el amor de su vida muere joven y por culpa de una miserable abeja.Esa perspectiva ampliada de la matriarca de los Bridgerton me pareció fenomenal y es gracias a esa historia que califico un poco más alto este libro.Happily Ever After is a lovely collection of second epilogues to the Bridgerton series.The Duke and I4 starsA sweet and heartwarming episode about an exceptionally happy marriage, with an even sweeter surprise.“Simon...”He nuzzled her ear. “Daphne...”His mouth moved along the line of her throat, and she felt herself melting. Twenty-one years of marriage and still...“At least draw the curtains,” she murmured.The Viscount Who Loved Me2 stars(originally published as an e-short)“This is Pall Mall. There is no fair play.”It was like a mildThe War of the Roses. I couldn’t find it amusing, but fortunately, Anthony and Kate’s marriage is much more harmonious than their Pall Mall-playing manners.An Offer From a Gentleman4 stars(originally published as an e-short)It is about Posy and not about Sophie and Benedict who happen to be one of my favorite couples, so it was a little disappointment for me. But just a little, as I liked Posy’s novella very much: a budding romance is always captivating, especially love at first sight. And as usual, it\\'s also written in a very engaging way.Sophie and Benedict appear in this story, and they are lovely.Benedict nodded slowly. “Do you think I should go out there?”“Don’t you dare!”“So I’m not supposed to protect her honor?”“It’s her first kiss!”He quirked a brow. “And here we are, spying on it.”“It’s my right,” Sophie said indignantly. “I arranged the whole thing.”Romancing Mister Bridgerton3 stars(originally published as an e-short)Chronologically, the story takes place after the Bridgerton brothers’ search for Eloise when she had run away inTo Sir Phillip, With Love. Colin and Penelope are newlyweds, and aside from some sweet thoughts for each other, it is not really their second epilogue, but an additional episode to Eloise’s book,To Sir Phillip, With Love.Colin and Penelope travel to Romney Hall for Eloise and Phillip’s wedding, where Penelope finally reveals her long-concealed identity to Eloise. It\\'s totally unnecessarily and overcomplicated, but the story is also full of witty dialogues, so it is amusing after all.“Eloise,” Penelope said, somewhat breathless from trying to shake off Hyacinth.“Penelope.” But Eloise’s voice sounded curious.“Eloise,” Hyacinth said, for no reason.“Hyacinth.”Penelope turned to her husband. “Colin.”He looked amused. “Penelope. Hyacinth.”Hyacinth grinned. “Colin.” And then: “Sir Phillip.”“Ladies.” Sir Phillip, it seemed, favored brevity.“Stop!” Eloise burst out. “What is going on?”“A recitation of our Christian names, apparently,” Hyacinth said.To Sir Phillip, With Love4 starsThis lovely story - unusually from Ms. Quinn - is told in first person, from Amanda’s viewpoint. Amanda now is 19, and has become an elegant, observant, and witty young lady. Not surprising, but still heartwarming to read about how much she loves her stepmother, Eloise, and how idyllic their life is.Amanda’s narration is smart and kindly sarcastic.She tells the story of meeting her future husband, Charles, and we get a glimpse of Eloise and Phillip as well.“My mother insisted upon a premarital chat, but this was conducted the night before the wedding, by which time the information was no longer exactly timely...”Lovely second epilogue!When He Was Wicked5 starsIt was such a sweet surprise!When He Was Wicked, the story of Francesca and Michael is not my favorite book of the Bridgerton series. But this novella is the best one of the second epilogues. First, it is about the two of them, and not someone else. Second, it is emotional and sweet.“He has your eyes,” Violet said, looking up at Francesca.Frannie nodded, and her smile was almost silly, as if she couldn’t quite believe it. “I know.”“And your mouth.”“I think you’re right.”“And your—oh, my, I think he has your nose as well.”“I’m told,” Michael said in an amused voice, “that I was involved in his creation, too, but I have yet to see any evidence.”Francesca looked at him with so much love that it nearly took Violet’s breath away. “He has your charm,” she said.It’s In His Kiss4 stars(originally published as an e-short)Just lovely! After fifteen years of crazy but unrelenting search finally Hyacinth did it! Isabella – as she is just like her mother – instinctively knew what Hyacinth needed: she wanted to be the one whofinds the diamonds.And I hope Isabella will never tell her the truth...Though the story is mainly about Hyacinth’s search, you also get a peek into Hyacinth and Gareth’s wonderfully happy marriage.On the Way to the Wedding1 starThe second epilogue continues exactly when the first one ends: the birth of Lucy and Gregory’s twins. Drama, drama, drama. Plus unimaginative and boring names for the babies.Violet in Bloom5 starsViolet in Bloomis Violet Bridgerton’s well-deserved story. It is funny, beautiful, heartbreaking, and tragic, but it also makes you smile. And eventually – aside from Edmund’s death – it couldn’t have happened any other way.Overall: 4 starsI will review about Simon and Daphne\\'s, Gregory and Lucy\\'s, and Violet\\'s happily ever afters only. As I have read, rated, and reviewed the rest before the release of this book.I was sad with the end of Bridgertons series because it is one of the best series I\\'ve ever read. And with amazing, wonderful stories in it. With this book, I am once again, fill with happiness! I\\'ve missed them so much!Duke and I: The 2nd Epilogue - 4 starsI wasn\\'t expecting to laugh out loud reading the story. Of course, it has got to be something about Simon and Daphne. And Colin and his family made appearances too.On the Way to the Wedding: The 2nd Epilogue - 4 starsFor this story, all I can say is that what happened to Lucy makes Gregory\\'s and my hair turn gray in fast pace.Violet in Bloom: Novella - 5 starsI had mixed feelings for this story. It is so beautiful but at the same time, heart wrenching! Finally, I got to know the late Edmund.[Edmund] was so happy. He made her happy.He was her other half [...] They would be young together, and then they would grow old together.\"And he laughed,\" Eloise said. \"He loved to laugh. He had the very best laugh, our papa...\"Oh I cried. Cried in the inside. I cried for Violet because she lost her dear beloved husband. I cried for Hyacinth because she wouldn\\'t know her father in different approach. The story is happy at first, not at the middle but okay in the end. But I felt sorrowful during my entire reading because I knew what happened then. It\\'s just so sad, really.I was left again yet by another mystery. I wonder, who is the man dancing with Violet at the masquerade ball?I think this is truly the end of Bridgertons series, huh. I love and miss the family. Always.Recommended.YOUTUBE/INSTAGRAM/RESEÑA EN WRAP UP ENERO 2021Un broche maravilloso para esta saga❤️.Confieso que al principio me asusté un poco porque el epílogo deEl duque y yo(el de Daphne y Simon) me dejó bastante indiferente.Pero cuando llegué aEl vizconde que me amóempecé a reírme a carcajada limpia, que es una de las cosas que más me gustan de estos libros.El epílogo deTe doy mi corazónme ha gustado porque ha tratado un tema que en el libro en sí quedaba inconcluso y que a mí me dio mucha curiosidad saber cómo acababa. Y por fin lo sé.Y lo mismo con el deSeduciendo a Mr. Bridgerton. Nos enseña cómo una persona se entera de cierto secreto más tarde que todo el mundo, y esa era una escena que me había faltado en los libros principales. Quizá esperaba un poco más de ella, pero aún así me ha gustado saberlo por fin.En cuanto aA sir Phillip, con amor, la narración ha sido curiosa porque ha sido en primera persona, algo que la autora no había hecho nunca antes en esta saga, y supongo que se debe a que así podemos conocer algo mejor a la narradora, Amanda, la hija adoptiva de Eloise.Y bueno, cuando llegué aEl corazón de una Bridgerton, mi propio corazón explotó. Sin duda alguna, es mi epílogo favorito de todo el libro. Por el tema que trata, la sensibilidad, lo que pasan (y sufren) los protagonistas. Michael y Francesca me gustan muchísimo.Los epílogos dePor un besoyBuscando esposatambién han estado bien, aunque no encuentro mucho que decir.Yla historia de Violet, la matriarca Bridgerton, no se queda muy a la zaga de la de Francesca. Ha sido bonito ver un poco por encima su historia con Edmund, pero ay💔. Sin embargo, creo que enseña muchas cosas importantes.Os lo recomiendo mucho si os han gustado los libros anteriores de los Bridgerton. Es un pequeño regalo de la autora, un vistazo a la vida de los personajes que tanto queremos al cabo de unos años. Como los demás, es ágil y rápido de leer.AVISO: es importante haber leído antes los 8 libros principales de la saga. Ahora bien, creo que este libro se puede leer de dos maneras. La primera es leerlo del tirón en noveno lugar, después de todos los anteriores. La segunda es leyendo cada epílogo que contiene este libro inmediatamente después de haber acabado el libro principal al que cada epílogo hace referencia.'}, {'title': 'Ice Planet Barbarians #3Barbarian Lover', 'author': 'Ruby Dixon', 'summary': 'The third novel in the Ice Planet Barbarians series, an international publishing phenomenon—now in a special print edition with bonus materials and an exclusive epilogue! Kira plans on remaining single on this alien planet—she doesn’t want a mate anyway. At least, that’s what she tells herself. But when Aehako comes along, everything changes. . . . As one of the humans stranded on the ice planet, I should be happy that I have a new home. Human women are treasured here, and one alien in particular has made it clear that he’s interested in me. It’s hard to push away the sexy, flirtatious Aehako when I long to grab him by his horns and insist he take me to his furs. But I’ve got a terrible secret—a few of them, actually. I’m convinced that Aehako can never love me if he knows the full truth. More worryingly, the aliens who abducted me are back, and thanks to the translator in my ear, they can find me. My presence here endangers everyone . . . but can I give up my new life and the man I desire more than anything? And will he even want me if he knows my secrets?', 'rating': '3.84', 'reviews': 'THIS ONE WAS SO MUCH BETTER!! oh, the wonders that can happen when some actual plot is added?? love to see it. i also ended up really liking love interest in this one, which is a new feeling lol.soft alien mates >>>>>>all of that sounds so good, right? then why only two stars? one of the things that set this book apart from the others is that the main character, kira, is infertile. because all the aliens are mating with the humans in each book, kira is concerned that she won’t be wanted/loved because she can’t have children. the story had the opportunity to go in a really good direction (there’s even a nice scene where aehako tells kira that he wants to be with her no matter what!!) but the ultimate conclusion of that part is kira being magically “healed” so that she can have kids with her hot alien. she’s overjoyed to not be “damaged” anymore, so she can have a fulfilling life....which, the underlying message of all that left a bad taste in my mouth and i really wish that ruby dixon hadn’t tried to fix what wasn’t actually broken.3 Stars - Full \"Review\" (I use that term loosely...) Now PostedThis is actually my least favorite so far, although I still enjoyed it.Kira was such a killjoy.Like Eeyore.In fact, Liz evencalledher an Eeyore, if I remember correctly.She for sure did in book 4.Here\\'s Liz being the annoying as fuck Tigger to Kira\\'s Eeyore:Word can\\'t describe how much I want to punch thatC-U-NexTWeek in the face.Except I DON\\'T feel awkward.And I KNOW I did.But I digress.Because of Kira being such a Debbie Fucking Downer, it was hard to get behind her story.In fact, when the sexy times finally happened, I mostly skimmed through them *gasp* that\\'s how disinterested I was in her love story.Regardless, I am totes loving this series.Although not gonna lieI AM having a hard time trying to visualize these blue-horned monsters as sexy.Cause all am a getting is a cross between this:(This:And some variation of this:With a horn-topped dick and a some ridged plate thing-ys.But aside from that?Find me at:4.5 Aehako Kira StarsMay have Mild SpoilersBook 3 was Kira the sad human with the translator in her ear, and happy go lucky Aehako. I know a lot of people didn\\'t care for Kira, and thought she was too sad and depressed, but I totally understood why she was so down. Kira had a ton of problems. Things looked bleak for her. She had a translator painfully jammed in her ear. It made everything loud super loud so she couldn\\'t sleep. She heard every rape, cry, and evil plan from the bad aliens. After she landed on not-hoth she heard everyone and everything that happened in the caves. From sex to rude comments she heard it all loud and clear. She had feelings for Aehako, but because of a health issues knew she was unable to get pregnant and would never resonate to Aehako. Top that off with the fact that she could hear the bad aliens saying they were coming back for the humans. Being scared that they could track her through the translator in her ear. Fear of being recaptured. Fear of dooming all the others to the same fate. Yeah I would be depressed as hell too.Aehako was everything Kira wasn\\'t. He balanced out her sadness. Aehako was a laid back, fun, enjoy every moment kind of guy. He knew bad things can and do happen, but he wanted to live life to it\\'s fullest. Kira was somber. She had a lot of bad things to deal with. Kira was shy, depressed, and scared. however she was also brave, sweet, and truly cared for the others. I liked but Kira and Aehako. I think they complimented each other well. They were a cute couple and they had a great foundation of friendship that deepened their love.I love that Ruby Dixon gives each character unique personalities. It makes them all more realistic and relatable. The plot of this one was a bit more heavy, with the bad aliens and all, but I think it was handled well. I loved that Aehako\\'s family was so supportive of his and Kira\\'s relationship. Harlow was an interesting woman. She has some secrets of her own, and I wonder what they are. There was some action towards the end. Some things happened that had me freaking out. Even though things ended in a HEA for Aehako and Kira, Harlow got a cliffhanger. I need to know what is going to happen so...... Off to book 4!!!!!!Living in fear of what might happen prevents us from enjoying what we have today.Aehako is sexy, sweet, nice, very good with his hands, open-minded and definitely interested in Kira. This was obvious in Barbarian Alien. Now it is the time to stake his claim. It doesn’t matter that his khui does not sing for her. Aehako is determined to make Kira his mate.“I do not need a khui to tell me who is the mate for me. You are mine and I will take every moment as a gift.”Kira is miserable. She is 22 years old, still virgin, unable to have children ever and constantly rejected by her old boyfriends. Moreover she is stuck with a painful translator inside her ear which the little green men have put inside her to communicate. Kira has helped a lot the girls to survive, but now the equipment is redundant and it may attract the little green men back. She knows why her khui does not sing and although she craves attention, she avoids Aehako for his own good.“I don’t want you to feel trapped with me.”The book is not as funny as the first two books, but very emotional and sweet. There is this joke that started from the previous book about the courting gift that Liz suggested, so that Aehako can officially court Kira. But after a while it does matter because the gift becomes really very useful.Aehako is mainly pushing Kira to open up, he does not get angry when she keeps things from him and he makes her feel good about herself. He will be the perfect boyfriend for the Sad Eyes human.Kira is mainly pushing Aehako away. She is scared, with low self esteem and constantly sad and jealous of the rest of the girls. Aehako needs to try very hard, but a little jealousy created by his ex-girlfriend, Asha, will help Kira and Aehako come together.“If you’re sure….”she says softly.“I was sure the moment I saw your face.”She pulls back, surprised. “You were?”I nod. “I saw you and thought, if ever there was a female that needed a male to make her smile, it was you. And that we would be perfect together.”5 ⭐ Did I really just give an alien erotica story 5-stars? Yes. Yes I did. 🙈Summary:Kira is one of twelve human women abducted and stranded on an ice planet. But, it\\'s not so bad. The native alien men may be tall, blue, and horned but they treasure women; and one alien, in particular, has made it clear he wants Kira. Aehako is sexy, flirtatious, and kind - exactly how she wants to take to the furs. However, this can\\'t happen.Kira is keeping secrets, which causes her to live in a state of constant fear. The first is that she cannot have children, so her khui will never resonate. The human women are new to this world and Kira is afraid that without the ability to bear children, the tribe might abandon her. The second, and most dangerous secret of all, is that the aliens who abducted the human women are back, and thanks to the translator in Kira\\'s ear, they can track her. Kira fears her presence endangers everyone and must decide if she should leave to save everyone.My Thoughts:Kira and Aehako are officially my favorite IPB couple.♥️ Their story is charming, heart-warming, sweet, and funny! It\\'s just everything!!!I freaking LOVE Aehako.He\\'s just a sweet himbo and absolutely loves Kira for who she is, even before resonance. And the courting present he gives Kira had me ROLLING!!!! I freaking couldn\\'t handle it! 😂I love Kira\\'s story/journey.She goes from being timid and afraid to a total badass who opens her heart to love in the face of uncertainty. Go, baby girl!!!Overall, Barbarian Lover is a fantastic sci-fi AND romance story.

The past, the present, and the future are about to collide in one pure moment--a moment of death or life, farewell or forever.', 'rating': '3.89', 'reviews': 'This is probably the hardest review I’ve ever had to write.Shivertears my heart in two every single time I read it. I feltLingerhad its problems, mostly in the diluted narrative with the addition of two more POVs, but it was still extremely moving and I wanted to see what happened next. How strange it is, then, to readForeverand experience nothing even close to the emotions the first two books inspired.The Wolves of Mercy Falls series is love story told almost like a fairy tale. Aside from the bittersweet urgency of the romance, one of the most poignant elements in the books to me has been the wolves’ desperate struggle to hang onto their human selves. The knowledge that they will lose every shard of awareness of who they are moves me unbearably, and Sam and Grace together are unlike any other couple I’ve ever read.I am far less interested in Isabel and Cole. I like them just fine, even though they are both just typical YA characters that can be found in 100 other novels. If they had an entirely different book to themselves I probably would like them better—but they don’t. They’re stuck right in the middle of Sam and Grace’s story, and the intrusiveness of losing momentum in every other chapter as the story switched to their first person POVs became an increasingly frustrating experience. This is the end. There are no more books. I don’t give a shit about Isabel’s ongoing daddy issues or Cole’s woe-is-me rock star problemsand it’s beyond weird that he’s the one with all the scientific solutions, all of which are rehashes from the previous book, I care about what happens to Sam and Grace. The story is even further fragmented by the addition of yetanotherPOV, which was completely unnecessary and added nothing to the story.There are too many starts and stops that interrupt the flow of the action, there is a scene of shocking uglinessinvolving the increasingly crazed Shelby and a dead birdthat I thought was completely out of place, and the actual resolution to the problem seemed to be dragged out far too long. I also didn’t find a single quote that I wanted to pull. I normally am rapturous over the author’s prose as well, but even the language inForeverdidn’t move me as much. Sam and Grace also seemed like shadows of their former selves, and I found myself becoming impatient with the way their narratives dawdled over insignificant details.The only scene that really moved me—yes, the only scene—comes very early in the book when Sam is racing to pick up Grace after she’s turned human again for the first time and the awful feelings he experienceswhen he arrives to find nothing but her clothes and a pair of shoes. There are a few good scenes later in the novel that involve some sacrifices, but I read them with a fairly detached attitude. I’m not sure if I’d just become so numb by that time that I wasn’t able to fully immerse myself again, or whether they really just didn’t hold the same urgency and depth that I\\'ve come to expect from this series.What I found most disappointing, however, is that so many scenes did not ring emotionally true. If you’ve been separated from the love of your life for months, the first thing you would do when you become human again is tofindhimfindhimfindhimand hang on tight before you lose yourself again. It’snotto wander out to have a random meaningless conversation with someone else. (And he would probably not have let you out of his sight to begin with.) The reunion scene was incredibly distant and anticlimactic, and the actual ending was even more of an emotional dodge. Everything honestly felt as though it was done for sake of a writing technique rather than something that was really true to the characters--or true to human nature.Readers who are invested in Isabel and Cole’s story will probably like this one much better than I did. But for me, this story has always been about the boy who became a wolf in winter and the girl who loved him. I am unbearably saddened that their beautiful story has become so diluted and so…mundane. It’s possible a future re-reading may make me look upon this book with a different perspective, but frankly that’s pretty hard to believe at this point. I bleeding heart loveShiverand will always be grateful for the beauty and wisdom and romance it brought into my life. But I will probably be much happier if I forever look upon it as a standalone novel that is perfect in and of itself.It breaks my heart to do this, but this is a2.5 starbook for me.This review also appears inThe Midnight Garden.New week,New BookTube Video- all about the best (and worst) literary couplesThe Written ReviewBook 1: Boy loves Girl.

Just because I didn\\'t like this book doesn\\'t mean I\\'m telling everyone not to read it. Everyone has different tastes and different opinions. And if your opinion is to come on MY review and tell me how awesome this book is and that I got it wrong. No I\\'m pretty sure I read this book correctly ..twice in fact. So keep to yourself, or write your own 5 star review so I can go on it and write \"omg!! You are wrong this book it terrible!! You have to hate it to bc I do!\"Giving it two stars but I will probably drop it down to one the more I think about this book and it\\'s horrible ending. Did she forget to finish the book? Is there a chapter that they accidentally didn\\'t put in the end? I felt like shiver and linger are two totally separate books from this one .. The first two were so good what the hell was this ?? I want my money back...and the more I think about this bull crap about the reader having to decide what happens in the end the more pissed off I get. No Maggie S I do not want to decide what happens in the end!! I want an ending..If I wanted to use my imagination I wouldnt have paid for a book!“People shouldn\\'t have to earn kindness. They should have to earn cruelty.”I think what kept me from readingForeveryears ago, was my fear that something depressing would happen to Grace and Sam. But most of all I didn\\'t want the series to end, because I loved it so much. Some books just make you feel happy from inside out, they give you the feeling of being home between their pages. That\\'s whatThe Wolves of Mercy Fallsis for me. And this last part of the series was as good as the first and second one.Find more of my books on Instagrameeeeeh....After reading the first two books, which were amazing, I have to say that this book was absolutelyPAINFULfor me to read. Maggie is a poet. I will give her that. She painted pictures in my head that were so precise for me that I didn\\'t have to fill in the blanks with my own creations. But that\\'s about all that I\\'m going to give praise for.The first big thing I had an issue with was that this book was so long and drawn out that the last 15% of the book was action, and then it was over and the book was finished.The next big thing was the interrogation with Sam and the officers. It was like she inserted this into the book and then didn\\'t think anything on it again. Tom Culpeper and his family just disappeared without a care in the world, and everyone\\'s problems are solved. Which leads me to my next issueNo one will know what happens with Isabel and Cole. Which really does tick me off. If I\\'m the only one then so be it, but I thought that after all of the \"changing\" that Isabel did she at least deserved a happy ending like Grace and Sam. Same with Cole. He could at least end up with the girl he wants. My God. Which in turn leads me to my next issue.Why on EARTH was Sam so damn annoying in this one. OH MG. I thought I was going to throttle him through the pages. He needed to become a leader a long time ago. It may be the fact that my boyfriend doesn\\'t show his emotions very often, and it\\'s what I\\'ve grown used to after 6 years, but please please please grow a pair. Hopefully M\\'s next male protagonist wont be a whining, pining, P. Whipped B. who cries every time his girlfriend leaves the room.Aside from all of the unanswered questions and Sam annoying the hell out of me...the thing that pissed me off the most was the ending.HOW DARE YOU KEEP US WAITING FOR 2 YEARS AND YOU DON\\'T EVEN GIVE US AN APPROPRIATE ENDING!!!!!What kind of shit is that. I putMY precious timeand money into this series and you leave the ending to our imagination!???!?!?! I don\\'t want to use my G.D. imagination I want you to F*#@ing TELL me what the Hell happens to Grace!@$* &^@^%$ #%&$*^ #$^^&%&@%!!!!!!!!!!!If you couldn\\'t tell from my rating I really didn\\'t like the ending of this book, and I think that the ending of a book counts for half of the goodness of the book!WHAT I WANT TO KNOW (unanswered questions)►What happened with Grace and her family?►What happened with the investigation against Sam regarding Olivia\\'s death and Grace\\'s disappearance?►What happens when Grace is injected with Meningitis?►What happens with Isabel and Cole?►Where does Sam stand with the pack, and will he keep on changing?►Why does the wolf virus look like Malaria?►Why do the wolves of Mercy Falls continue to change, and why does the change eventually blot out their human-ness?'}, {'title': 'The Greene Sisters #1The Neighbor Favor', 'author': 'Kristina Forest', 'summary': \"In this heart-fluttering romance by Kristina Forest, a shy bookworm enlists her charming neighbor to help her score a date, not knowing he's the obscure author she's been corresponding with.Shy, bookish, and admittedly awkward, Lily Greene has always felt inadequate compared to the rest of her accomplished family, who strive for Black excellence.

Dear Kristina Forest, please keep on writing adult fictions! You did an excellent job.Shy, kind, gold hearted bookworm Lily, caring, lonely, reserved, talented author Nick, running from his dark past are amazing characters. I loved their blooming love story.

I highly recommend this sentimental, powerful, poignant romance book! It made me smile and warmed my heart!Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.bloginstagramfacebooktwitterthis was pretty charming! i loved that these two were bookish and how that played into their relationship.did i love the secret identity bit? not so much. but that is definitely my own hangup.Cute, cute, fuckin cute! \\U0001f979This made my heart all kinds of fuzzy. Not only because of how sweet the romance was but also because it has an element included that I just adore: it’s a book about books. You can just never go wrong with that.Add a romance on top of that, and it’s guaranteed win! 😍“Nothing about me was particularly exceptional. But whenever I was reading, I didn’t think about that. The escapism saved me too.”It’s the type of book that starts off quiet but gets more intense and gets you more invested the more you read. The more you get to know the characters and are exposed to their vulnerabilities, the more attached you find yourself becoming to their journey.Well, that was the case for me.I loved every moment of this story. I was never bored, I adored the journey the author took these characters on and how well we got to know them individually. I was rooting for their romance, despite the slight deceptive element. But the way the author decided to handle it, made me okay with it because it made sense for them..The story as a whole felt comforting and warm and hopeful, despite there being a twinge of sadness present.“His own self-perception wasn’t so positive yet, but he could work to improve it. He wanted to be better for Lily. He wanted to be better for himself. He couldn’t let this shit hold him back anymore.”And I’m so glad we’re getting a book on Violet next. I loved the family element and I hope we get a book on their other sister, Iris, too!Trigger warnings: parental neglect/abuse, cheating (side character).\"}, {'title': 'Marriage Game #1The Marriage Game', 'author': 'Sara Desai', 'summary': \"A high stakes wager pits an aspiring entrepreneur against a ruthless CEO in this sexy romantic comedy.After her life falls apart, recruitment consultant Layla Patel returns home to her family in San Francisco.

Yes, he just collapses on the floor because he’s having heart attack and last thing he told his daughter, he made a lease agreement for the place but he would call and cancel it.Yeap, father is in hospital, he didn’t make the call he mentioned and charming, sexy, over confident, narcissistic and partly douchebag Sam Mehta appears at the office as Layla starts to throw her entire office equipment to his face and scream!Yes, our MCs meet and they start to feel the undeniable sexual chemistry as soon as they lay eyes on each other. Wow! Yes the room, the room, the room is on fire! (Normally it should be roof but you got what I meant.) You just patiently wait them tear each other’s clothes and wait for the genre’s changing into erotic romance. There are so many hotness and naughtiness in this story but it is sooo much fun!Sam says he has his contract and she gotta leave the place. Layla says he should show some respect! Her father is in coma at the hospital, she has nowhere else to go and family comes first.Well, Sam’s family, especially his sister comes first, too. He still blames himself what has happened to her at the hospital (he also quits his residency and dreams of being doctor and starts working at downsizing business management, yes instead of saving lives now he is ending people’s career dreams but he has a reason: her sister got married with drunk and abuser scumbag/ a famous doctor in the hospital he works. The worst thing is: he was the one who introduced them and that human waste doctor might have hurt her sister and been the reason that she will never walk again!!!)And when they continue to their shouting contest, a guy comes to their office asking for Layla and he tells her he is the one she is going to marry. WHAT? Yes, I didn’t mention the book starts with the letter, written by Layla’s father, added to the dating site, indicating that Layla looks for husband and the candidates will be evaluated by him.As Layla enters his father’s email account she finds out he evaluated the guys and chose 10 special candidates and 10 blind dates for her daughter. Layla wants to cancel the meetings but then she realizes those blind dates can be her father’s last wish. And she makes an offer to Sam to join her dates with her. If she finds the ideal groom, she will leave the office for him. But if she cannot find, Sam will look another place. They shake hands and MARRIAGE GAMES begin.But both of them know neither Layla nor Sam wants to find the perfect candidate because they’re head over heels in love with each other.By the way my favorite candidate was CIA agent! When I’m reading his parts, I laughed too hard and fell down the couch. It was HILARIOUS!I enjoyed this whirlwind and entertaining book so much but last parts and too much angst and Sam’s obnoxious attitudes made me so much pissed ( I even thought to lower my points) butOVERALL this is unique, hot, funny, vivid reading and I cannot deny how much fun I had so I’m giving 4.5 and rounding them up 5 stars! But I still want to punch hero and I’m big fan of brave, sassy, smart, ball of fire, impulsive, witty, sexy Layla! Atta girl! Those stars come for you!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazingly funny ARC in exchange my honest review. I personally congratulate Sara Desai for her fantastic debut and I cannot wait to read her future works. ( P.S.

But Layla\\'s father suffers a heartattack just before he\\'s able to inform Sam Mehta, CEO of a corporate downsizing company, that the office is no longer available.After the shock of realising the predicament they\\'re in, they agree to share the office.Both of them are in for a surprise when suitors start knocking on their door looking for Layla. Layla\\'s dad also failed to mention that he set up 10 blind dates for her. She decides to go on these dates with the help of Sam to see if her soul mate might be one of these men.The first half of this book was great! This book is steeped in Indian culture and I loved that! It felt cozy and I was living for every mention of jalebi, garam masala and samosas. I loved Layla and I loved that we both agree that dal is the best comfort food and we both make roti when in need of a stress relief.It was ridiculously funny, dramatic and slightly unrealistic and I was okay with that.What I wasn\\'t okay with was when things took a turn for the worst at about 70% in and just... Stayed like that.Without spoiling, I\\'ll just say that Sam did something shitty and terrible and I don\\'t think he redeemed himself properly. It was brushed over way too easily for my liking. If it was me, I would not have forgiven him.I lost respect for Layla after that.This book could easily have been a 5 star for me. I was having a fun time until Sam messed it all up. I still feel a bit crushed, and my disappointment is huge.Buddy read withWarda,AmeerahandMay🌸3.5 starsThe Marriage Gameis Sara Desai’s debut novel, and what a delight it is! I had so much fun reading this book.Layla comes back home to California from NYC after her current relationship ends and she loses her job. She’s in her mid twenties and starting fresh again. She’s ready for a new job and a new start, and her father is ready for her to find a husband. He sets up an on-line dating profile for her and picks 10 guys for her to meet.Sam is renting the office above Layla’s family’s restaurant, and Layla is also planning on using the space to start her new business. These two are not a good match, and couldn’t be more different, but with time, they start to grow on each other. Sam even insists on coming on Layla’s blind dates. These were some of my favorite scenes of the book.“It also says here that you’re a good girl.” His voice dropped to a sensual purr and he leaned toward her. “Are you a good girl, Layla? You seem very bad to me. If you need a husband who can keep you in line, you’ll have to up your game.”Sam and Layla’s banter was so much fun. I loved watching them go on the ‘dates’ together. Layla was independent and fiery and I loved her character. Sam was great… for most of the book. I also adored so many of the side characters. Layla’s dad was my absolute favorite. I also loved Sam’s sister, friend John, and Layla’s cousin, Daisy.Honestly, I loved the first 75% of this book so much. I had such a huge smile on my face and the banter and storytelling was fantastic. The last 25% though… there were some parts I didn’t love. The very end was great, but getting there was rough for me. Overall, this was good for me and I will definitely be reading more from this author in the future.If you’re looking for a sweet and fun rom-com that’s a good time, pick upThe Marriage Game!'}, {'title': 'The Prince and the Dressmaker', 'author': 'Jen Wang', 'summary': 'Paris, at the dawn of the modern age:Prince Sebastian is looking for a bride―or rather, his parents are looking for one for him. Sebastian is too busy hiding his secret life from everyone. At night he puts on daring dresses and takes Paris by storm as the fabulous Lady Crystallia―the hottest fashion icon in the world capital of fashion!Sebastian’s secret weapon is his brilliant dressmaker, Frances―his best friend and one of only two people who know the truth: sometimes this boy wears dresses. But Frances dreams of greatness, and being someone’s secret weapon means being a secret. Forever. How long can Frances defer her dreams to protect her friend?Jen Wang weaves an exuberantly romantic tale of identity, young love, art, and family. A fairy tale for any age, The Prince and the Dressmaker will steal your heart.', 'rating': '4.34', 'reviews': 'This was absolutely adorable.I\\'m not exaggerating when I say books like this really do restore a little of my faith in humanity. It\\'s a really cute story but, as a person who generally prefers \"tense\" and \"gritty\" over \"cute\" reads, it\\'s not too saccharine as to be unbearable. This is a good graphic novel for readers who enjoy the occasional fun read likeSimon vs. the Homo Sapiens AgendaorMy Lady Jane.The illustrations are simple and cartoonish, but still good. It suits the tone of the story, to be honest.The Prince and the Dressmakeris about Frances, a Parisian dressmaker who suddenly receives an amazing opportunity to make dresses for royalty-- Prince Sebastian, to be precise!Together the pair dazzle around Paris at night, with Sebastian - or Lady Crystallia - wearing Frances\\'s gorgeous creations. But by day he must go back to being the prince and Frances must keep his secret. Friendship grows between them, and then something else, but when Sebastian\\'s secret threatens an amazing opportunity for Frances, things get complicated.Both characters are wonderful and lovable and, as readers shall soon see, they are surrounded by some pretty amazing secondary characters, too.

All of the stars for it!!!Loved, loved, loved! The art style was colorful and cute and atmospheric, which is exactly what I enjoy in a graphic novel. It takes place in late 19th century France, which gives the story a slightly fairytale vibe. The characters were lovable and helped each other become the best versions of themselves. And, of course, my favorite aspect was how respectfully gender identity is discussed.I could go on and on about what I loved, but I think you get the point.One issue I had was that the main character was forced into coming out during a public event, but I loved the happily ever after both protagonists were ultimately given!'}, {'title': 'You Should See Me in a Crown', 'author': 'Leah  Johnson', 'summary': \"Liz Lighty has always believed she's too black, too poor, too awkward to shine in her small, rich, prom-obsessed midwestern town. But it's okay -- Liz has a plan that will get her out of Campbell, Indiana, forever: attend the uber-elite Pennington College, play in their world-famous orchestra, and become a doctor.But when the financial aid she was counting on unexpectedly falls through, Liz's plans come crashing down . . . until she's reminded of her school's scholarship for prom king and queen. There's nothing Liz wants to do less than endure a gauntlet of social media trolls, catty competitors, and humiliating public events, but despite her devastating fear of the spotlight she's willing to do whatever it takes to get to Pennington.The only thing that makes it halfway bearable is the new girl in school, Mack. She's smart, funny, and just as much of an outsider as Liz. But Mack is also in the running for queen. Will falling for the competition keep Liz from her dreams . . . or make them come true?A newer edition of ISBN 9781338503265 can be found here.\", 'rating': '4.08', 'reviews': \"I... can’t hold enough of this book in my hands. I listened to the audiobook, and it wassuperb. I listened toYou Should See Me in a Crowneverywhere, but then it was over and I mourned its loss. I wished, then, that the story could be solid and picked up and held close, so that I could reach for it and trace the words with my fingers whenever I needed. I immediately ordered a physical copy right there and then.You Should See Me in a Crownfollows the story of Liz Lighty who wants nothing but to not feel an ache in her soul where some part of her always feels wanting. Liz hung her hopes on a scholarship to Pennington—her dream school—which she believed would be “the fast track to the rest of [her] life.” But a rejection letter douses Liz’s dream in her chest, and Liz suddenly feels she has lost her own story, fallen out of its pages, and landed in a country from which she couldn’t return. But when her brother convinces her to run for prom queen—with its $10,000 scholarship prize—the idea strikes Liz as sensible in a mad sort of way. Liz—who is accustomed to being quiet and feels secure in the near invisibility her insignificance in the high school hierarchy bestows upon her—knows this is her only chance, but dreads the exhausting artifice that comes when you put yourself onstage, and ask to be judged. A burning determination glows in Liz, nonetheless. Liz will be her school’s “infamous, subversive, dangerous, queer-as-hell prom queen wannabe” if that’s what it takes to seize her dreams. The playing field might be a steep incline with Liz at the bottom with boulders attached to both her ankles, but she is determined to push and push until something breaks in her favor, for once. That’s the Lighty Way, after all.We feel, but we always fight. It’s the Lighty Way.Johnson tells a deeply compassionate and tender story about the howling cold of unbelonging—that lonely dwelling-place inside that sometimes threatens to leak out and drown you—and her telling found the seams inside me and tugged. What hangs over Liz, and what the author illustrates so beautifully, is the traces of shadow where a broken system—or rather, a system that is working just as designed—has been breaking its hand against the bones of people who didn’t fit the mold of “cis, het, and white.” Liz Lighty is surrounded on all sides by people who move through the world without expectation of a door slammed in their faces, people who would look at her from the narrow parapet of their noses and finding her wanting. For years, Liz had let their words lurk quietly under the surface of herself. She learned to whittle herself down to a few essential truths—being a good granddaughter and sister, an excellent student, a first-chair clarinet player—keep her head down, and fit the small shape the world left for her. But Liz is fed up with the idea of being judged, cast in a role, given a title, measured up, inevitably found lacking—and I was buoyed by the wellspring of strength and defiance she was capable of drawing from. The heart of the novel, after all, is clear, star-bright, and powerful. There’s a fire burning inYou Should See Me in a Crownlike furnace doors thrown wide open so you can feel the flames, the bright fire of someone who is determined to exist in a way that is unpalatable to others, who is unafraid to take up space, to participate in the world, to reach out and grasp its beating core with bare hands, to be awake.The friendships in this book are also so good. Liz’s friends are a calm and steady port in the storm of her life, the ones who would shore her up, and wrap up the hurt. They’re the grass between the nettles—a safe place for her to land. But friends can break your heart too and the novel doesn’t shy away from showing how friendship breakups can carve just as deep. Liz’s friendship with Jordan, in particular, pierced a little too close to my heart. Liz passes Jordan in the school hallways, works besides him on extracurricular activities, and does her best to act as if they had never quarreled, and never parted and were in fact no more than casual acquaintances in the first place. But Liz feels the distance between them keenly. The memory of what he’s done four years before is a fresh stab: not just disappointment, or anger, but grief too, real grief, for something lost. But Liz and Jordan are planets in orbit, pulling at each other as surely as gravity. Their friendship might be damaged and eroded, but it was not destroyed. They had both given each other wounds, but they were not mortal, and in their own halting ways, they were trying very hard to make amends, to make up for the hurt, so that their jagged edges might once again fit together like puzzle pieces.The tenderness with which the author writes the sapphic romance blooming between Liz and Mack—Liz’s rivaling prom queen candidate—is so ineffable and aching, and it tugged at my heart. I yearned to find some way to hook myself to their story, to their soft moments together, and never leave. And oh my god, their first kiss! I must’ve played that part at least a dozen times lol.Because here, always, we deserve this good thing.All in all, the experience of readingYou Should See Me in a Crownfelt like pulling the curtains open on a sunny morning. It's sweet, moving, and so tenderly told.This book was so stinkin' cute! It was hard not to smile the whole time while reading about such cute compatible characters coming together. I loved the ending, without spoiling anything it was very heartwarming. Liz was a great character and seeing her romance with Amanda bloom was adorable! Watching two girls fall in love in a small town and shake things up was awesome. But there was also a lot of layers to this story, so it had so much going for it. A great Valentine's day read overall!This was so fucking cute, I can't stand it.

But rather than drowning her sorrows in bags of potato chips, Maddie leaves L.A. to claim the inheritance left by her free-spirited mother—a ramshackle inn nestled in the little coastal town of Lucky Harbor, Washington.Starting over won't be easy. Yet Maddie sees the potential for a new home and a new career—if only she can convince her two half-sisters to join her in the adventure. But convincing Tara and Chloe will be difficult because the inn needs a big makeover too.The contractor Maddie hires is a tall, dark-haired hottie whose eyes—and mouth—are making it hard for her to remember that she's sworn off men. Even harder will be Maddie's struggles to overcome the past, though she's about to discover that there's no better place to call home than Lucky Harbor.\", 'rating': '3.91', 'reviews': 'Simply Irresistible is book one in the wonderful Lucky Harbor series by Jill Shalvis. I’ve read several books by Ms. Shalvis from her other series and a later one in this series. But because a dear friend gave me the first two books in this series for Christmas, I finally get to see where it all began. This book was simply delightful, from start to finish. I can’t say enough how much I loved it.Maddie Moore needs to start over. She has gotten out of a destructive relationship in Los Angeles but as a by product, lost her job. She barely knew her mother and was raised by her Dad. But, her mother unexpectedly passed away and left Maddie one third of an inn in the very small town of Lucky Harbor, Washington. Maddie has spent little time with her two half sisters, Chloe, the youngest, and Tara, the oldest. But they are all meeting to spend a few days at the inn and decide what to do. Maddie sees this as an opportunity for a new life, new town, new job. But majority rules. Will her sisters agree or want to sell?Jax Cullen used to be a cut throat attorney in Seattle. He slowly was losing his very soul to the job and didn’t like who he had become. One very tragic event helped him to decide to walk away. So he moved back to his home town of Lucky Harbor and started building things which is what he loved. It’s been five years and he is slowly coming back to himself but he hasn’t allowed himself to really care for a woman. And then Maddie walked into his life. Maddie was funny, clutzy, sweet, and most definitely had something in her past. She was skittish and all the evidence was there that she had been hurt. Jax was a very patient man, though.The inn is in bad shape and the three sisters decide that before they can make a decision as to whether they will sell or stay, they at least need to make basic repairs. So, a contractor needs to be hired. And guess who the best contractor in town is? Mr. Hottie himself, Jax Cullen.Jax pursues Maddie persistently and slowly builds her back up. Maddie has sworn off men but Jax most definitely makes her rethink that strategy. These two together were as sweet as they could be. Jax was everything you could want in a Hero. And the more you get to know him, and see the things he has done for the town, you will love him even more. Still, there are some things he doesn’t share with Maddie and she knows he is holding something back.Not only will you fall in love with Maddie, but with her two sisters as well. And with Jax’s two best friends, Ford and Sawyer. The next two books in the series will focus on them. This is one of those books you just can’t put down but you also don’t want it to end. You will fall in love with this sweet town and it’s residents. And you will love Maddie and Jax. If you haven’t read this yet, I so hope you’ll give it a try. I can’t wait to start book two, The Sweetest Thing.“I came to Lucky Harbor out of obligation, but really, I was looking for something.”“Did you find it?”“Yeah, I found it.”Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time reading reviews. Just skip them and go buy this book. Just do it. But if you just can’t help yourself, if you simplymustread a review, I’ll give you a little something more.Simply Irresistibleis the first book in theLucky Harborseries and such a great story. I\\'m sitting here with this silly grin on my face because it\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve read a book,anybook, that had me smiling, giggling, sighing and fanning myself as much as this one did. Simply put,Simply Irresistibleis a wonderful, funny, sexy, romantic, feel good story!I went to sleep thinking about this book and woke up thinking about it. The hero, Jax, is the kind of man that you really could find in Anytown, USA, and the heroine, Maddie, is a real woman. The kind with curves, flaws and insecurities... someone we canallrelate to.The bottom line - I repeat - don\\'t waste your time reading all the 5 star reviews when your time can be better spent readingSimply Irresistible!Save yourself the time and trouble of having to kick yourself later for having not read it sooner, and just go buy this book.Now.5 Stars -Also reviewed at:Lady Jayne\\'s Reading DenDo. Not. Resist. This. Book! READ IT. NOW!!! FOR THESIMPLY IRRESISTIBLEJAX CULLEN, ALONE! JILL SHALVIS ROCKS!!!(I decided to repeat this straight up top, instead of waiting till near the end of my review. LOL)Zosia, Thanks for your review of this, which made me want to read it!After the amazing yet emotionally intense and tumultuous experience of The Bronze Horseman Trilogy, I needed a light and humorous yet-still-touch-me-emotionally kind of romance, set during the Holiday Season. AndSIMPLY IRRESISTIBLEwasjustwhat I needed for my Christmas beach holiday read! What aJOYto read! I really enjoyed Jill Shalvis\\' writing style.Simply Irresistibleis the story of sweet, klutzy, adorable Maddie Moore, with her curly, wild blonde hair, who returns to Lucky Harbor, Washington, after losing her job and boyfriend. Maddie and her two half-sisters, Tara and Chloe, have inherited their free-spirited mother’s inn by the sea, Lucky Harbor Resort, which is in serious need of repairs and TLC.Maddie \"the Mouse\", determined to make a new start, sees the potential for a new home and career in the inn. The challenge will be in convincing her two sisters to let her, considering one of them wants to sell and the other is undecided. I really loved seeing the relationships grow and develop between these three very different sisters, who never spent much time together while growing up, having been raised apart. It was very heartwarming.The other challenge will be in resisting the HOTTIE she meets, considering she has completely sworn off men... for now, anyway. While driving to the resort along a narrow, winding road, munching on salt and vinegar chips, Maddie almost runs over a tall, broad shouldered “Hot Biker Guy”, with wavy dark brown hair and caramel eyes.I really liked the “meet cute”, as it would be called in a Rom-Com :-). After Maddie apologises, and “Hot Biker Guy” picks off half a salt and vinegar chip from her sleeve, Maddie decides she needs a way to escape from this awkward situation…“What she needed now was an exit plan. So she put the phone to her ear, pretending it was vibrating. “Hello,” she said to no one. “Yes, I’ll be right there.” She smiled, likelook at me, so busy, I really have to go, and, turning away, she lifted a hand in a wave, still talking into the phone to avoid an awkward goodbye, except –Her phone rang. And not the pretend kind. Risking a peek at Hot Biker Guy over her shoulder, she found him brows up, looking amused.”Haha! Nice try, Maddie! ^o^ This book was off to a great start!Turns out, “Hot Biker Guy” is Jax Cullen, the contractor and master carpenter that Maddie needs to help fix up the inn.I was smiling and laughing A LOT while reading this, and also had many shivers and tingles from the palpable sexual tension and electrifying chemistry between Maddie and Jax.\"Clearly reading her mind, his mouth slowly curved. “So no interest, and certainly no chemistry,” he murmured, dipping his head to take in the fact that her misbehaving nipples were pressing up against the words BITE ME on her T-Shirt.“R-right,” she managed. “No chemistry whatsoever.” But then she took a step into him instead of away, and look at that, suddenly his mouth was just there, and her hands were fisting in his fleece hoodie.How had that happened?\"Jax Cullen isHOT!!!Yes, well deserving of bolded all caps - Not only because of his good looks, but his kindness, intelligence, loyalty, dependability, how much he cares for people, the way he teased and flirted with Maddie, all his light touches, determined to seduce the woman who said she���d sworn off men. I loved the way he was always there for Maddie when she needed him. Jax just SIZZLED off the page in his low slung tool belt, in a very sexy and adorable way.Here’s a little sample of Jax’sHOTness in a scene where the Jax is chopping some firewood:\\'\"Um, Jax?\"He glanced over his shoulder.\"You look...\"Hot.\"Overheated. Probably you should take off your other shirt, too.\"\"You think?\"Oh, yeah. Not trusting her voice, she merely nodded.His lips quirked, but he said nothing as he reached up and behind him, tugging the shirt over his head in one smooth, very male motion.And then he stood before her in those low-slung jeans, tool belt, and nothing else but a gleam of sweat.\"Better,\" she tried to say, staring at his tatts, but it came out more as a squeak. She was lucky not to be a puddle on the ground. Honest to God, the man shouldn\\'t be allowed to look like that. It just wasn\\'t fair to all the other men on the planet.Turning to his task, he went at the wood for a while. Maddie backed up to a large wood round and plopped down. After a few minutes, Tara came out with a peace-offering tray of iced tea and glasses. \"Oh, sweet Jesus,\" she whispered, eyes locked on Jax as she sank to the log next to Maddie.\\'I was virtually plopping down right along with Maddie and Tara, enjoying this “visual” and needing a cold glass of ice tea, myself, to run along my overheated skin! ^_^Granted, though I had Ryan Reynolds in my mind as my Jax Cullen, this scene didnothave him looking like this:Well…at least, NOT the crazy eyes! *LOL* But mostdefinitelythe ripped, glistening body. *fans self*His face looking more smouldering, likeTHIS, in my mind:OOooooohhhh…..YEEEEEAAAAHHHHH…… @_@And playful, flirty and amused, like THIS:And just in case you’re still having trouble picturing the delicious Jax Cullen with his sexy tool belt and low slung jeans….“If I looked like him,” Tara said. “I’d want to have sex with myself. All the time.”Did your eyes just go hazy? Yeah, I know, Jax has that effect…But I digress….If you are after a really fun, romantic and sexy Contemporary Romance, with a lovable cast of characters, which will make you smile right down to your toes (well, make your toes curl, in any case), thenDo. Not. Resist. This. Book! READ IT FOR THESIMPLY IRRESISTIBLEJAX CULLEN, ALONE!And while this is set during the Holiday Season, you need not (should not) wait until December 2011 to enjoy this. Jax Cullen is a gift to be enjoyed, no matter the time of year!Speaking of gifts, here\\'s a Jax Cullen hand towel gift. Great for those... overheated... moments. ^_^I am very much looking forward to Tara’s book,The Sweetest Thing, coming out on1st April 2011... and reading more of Jill Shalvis\\' books, since this was my first, but will certainly not be my last.Jill Shalvis had some lovely inspiration during the writing of Simply Irresistible.

Blame the holidays.)It\\'s themothersister of all \"what exactly does he see in her?\" stories.One of these days, I\\'m going to find a book where the hero just straight-up admits that he found the heroine \"sexy as hell.\" I can buy that. I can buy insta-lust. What I can\\'t buy is the hero being intrigued for no apparent reason.SHE RAN HIM OFF THE ROAD WHILE HE WAS ON HIS MOTORCYCLE AND HE WAS INSTANTLY HOOKED.Does this even make sense to anyone?So you\\'d think...okay, maybe this Maddie chick will do something spectacular to make up for her carelessness of running this guy off the road.1. She almost didn\\'t stop after running him off the road.2. She had potato chips all over her shirt.3. She lied about being on the phone while driving.4. The next time she saw him, she was being a klutz...as well as the time after that. Because, you know, almost knocking someone\\'s bike over is sexxxay. So is falling on your ass.Yeah, this chick\\'s a winner.GTFO of here. Really?Maybe it wouldn\\'t have been so bad if the hero wasn\\'t drop-dead gorgeous. And a bartender. And a handyman. And the mayor. And filled every single job in the town, single-handedly making every woman want him. So naturally, he picks careless-driving, potato-chip-wearing, ass-falling, klutzy girl.JUST ADMIT ALREADY THAT YOU THOUGHT SHE HAD NICE BOOBS AND YOU WANTED TO TAP THAT. Because I didn\\'t find Maddie to be charming or cute in any way.And...the author\\'s version of comedy (at least I hope that\\'s what it was) was putting the heroine on a washer/dryer to uh...relieve herself. While the hero walks in.Womp womp.Review posted on:Swept Away By Romance4 to 4 1/2 starsI loved this book! Loved it!Simply Irresistibleis my first experience reading a Jill Shalvis book and it certainly won\\'t be my last! I\\'m still baffled by how long it\\'s take me to read one of her books.Simply Irresistibleis a sweet, flirty, feel good romance overflowing with wonderful characters, humor, romance, and a swoonalicious hero that deserves to be called a hero.Oh, how I love Jax! He\\'s everything I admire in a hero! The heroine, Maddie, was an oxymoron for me. She was as charming and lovable as she was frustrating. Her battle with her insecurities drove me slightly crazy but also endeared me to her. But where this book really shined for me was in the complex relationships and the sharp-tongued yet warm-hearted banter that the author created between the three sisters, Maddie, Tara, and Chloe. Their hilarious interactions with each other were some of my favorite parts of this story.Simply Irresistiblewas an absolutely delightful read. This feel-good book was exactly what I needed. The ending was heart-warming and left a huge smile on my face. I\\'m eagerly looking forward to reading the next book in this series.'}, {'title': 'Starry Eyes', 'author': 'Jenn Bennett', 'summary': 'Ever since last year’s homecoming dance, best friends-turned-best enemies Zorie and Lennon have made an art of avoiding each other. It doesn’t hurt that their families are the modern-day Californian version of the Montagues and Capulets.But when a group camping trip goes south, Zorie and Lennon find themselves stranded in the wilderness. Alone. Together.What could go wrong?With no one but each other for company, Zorie and Lennon have no choice but to hash out their issues via witty jabs and insults as they try to make their way to safety. But fighting each other while also fighting off the forces of nature makes getting out of the woods in one piece less and less likely.And as the two travel deeper into Northern California’s rugged backcountry, secrets and hidden feelings surface. But can Zorie and Lennon’s rekindled connection survive out in the real world? Or was it just a result of the fresh forest air and the magic of the twinkling stars?', 'rating': '3.97', 'reviews': '3.75*DNF at 300 pages can’t recommendedUgh, cuteness galore!Features:• A protagonist who’s super into planning everything!• Has a Korean mother who’s a masseuse• A lesbian couple for neighbours with a son that’s pretty much a genius (and that I’m in love with!)• His mothers are so loving it makes me sick• Oh and they own a sex toy shop.

I adored the characters and the journey they undertook, where she ended up discovering herself and to take life as it is, and deal with whatever it may throw at you.If you love your contemporaries, I can’t recommend this book enough.“A map of us. It\\'s years in the making, and it\\'s messy and convoluted, some of it even tragic. But I wouldn\\'t change the route, because we walked it together, even when we were apart. And the best part about it is that it\\'s unfinished. Uncertainty isn\\'t always a bad thing. Sometimes it can even be filled with extraordinary potential.”Best YA Contemporary I’ve read all year? Yes. Best YA Contemporary I’ve read ever? Perhaps. From the beautiful romance, to the masterful different family dynamic depictions, to just having a story that made me smile on almost every page. Friends, this made my heart so very happy, and now I just want to read any and everything that Jenn Bennett has written and will write.Basically, this is a story about two families, who live right next to each other, who also have places of business right next to each other. One family is two sapphic women and their son, who own a sex shop, unapologetically. And the other family owns some sort of health medical practice, where the father is embarrassed to be so close to a sex shop, while the mother and daughter do not care in the slightest. The families used to be close with one another, but a secret falling out has led to them not speaking at all. But, friends, I promise you, this is the best boy next door story I’ve read maybe ever.➽Zorie- Obsessed with all things astronomy, and even though she has been isolating herself from her old friends, when she gets the opportunity to go glamping with them, she takes it as an opportunity to shoot the stars and accepts. Zorie is also dealing with a probable secret that her father has been harboring, when she unexpectedly gets some of his mail.➽Lennon- Biracial, nerdy, and so very into hiking and camping. And because of a sudden unexpected turn of events, he is also going on the glamping trip, even though him and Zorie haven’t spoken as friends in a long while.You all probably see where this is going, but what I didn’t see coming is them getting lost in the woods and becoming somewhat dependent on one another to survive. I for sure wouldn’t say this is a survival story, but there are some high risks that really kept me on the edge of my seat.But obviously romance blooms and I couldn’t get enough of this story. I was honestly swooning, and the chemistry between these two characters was utter perfection while also being so damn believable. Also, this book was so sex positive! And I was completely living for it! Normalize healthy and consensual sex in YA, thank you! And thank you Jen Bennett, because she totally delivered inStarry Eyes.I also want to touch upon Zorie’s relationship with her stepmother, because it was truly the best adoption relationship I’ve ever read in all my years. Joy was honestly the best side character; she’s Korean, she\\'s kind, and she’s the mother of my dreams, honestly. No spoilers, but when she told Zorie that she was the reason…. I cried so hard. Blood will only ever just be blood, and blood has nothing to do with who you claim as your parent, and this book honestly is five stars alone because of Joy and Zorie’s relationship. Again, my heart is so very full.Overall, this book really just brought me so much bliss. It touched upon so many hard-hitting topics, the relationship dynamics were so expertly done, the family (both blood and found) was beyond words perfect, and the romance still has me weak in the knees. Seriously, I know I made this joke 102 times on Booktube, but I want to buy a tent and a rainstorm with Park Jimin. Okay. Pick up this book. Love you all, bye.Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Tumblr|Youtube|TwitchContent and Trigger Warnings:Ophidiophobia (fear of snakes), loss of a parents in the past, infidelity of a side character, talk of suicide, homophobia (always in a negative light), and grief depiction.Buddy read withAmy,Jane&Madalyn! ❤❤ I read this forThe Reading Rush, 2019!“What\\'s that?\"\"French press.\"\"For coffee?

BUT something other than the quality of the book ruined it for me.So, I like survival-style books. I love watching characters trek their way across the landscape and overcome various challenges.And that part of the book worked pretty well for me. It was cool to see the terrain and learn about wilderness survival.HOWEVER- the characters.Ugh. I wanted toSHAKEthem.Zorie as the main character was soannoyingly vapid and quirky-cute(but in a forced way). Bleh.She knew nothing about pop culture (in an unbelievable way - it was like she lived in a bubble in the middle of the ocean for the last 16 years).She had a knack for asking the dumb questions and making assumption-leaps that had me tilting my head.Essentially, every time she came on the page...which was every page cause she was a MC...it annoyed me.Lennon was alright but he was spoiled by the sheer presence of Zorie.Also, hugeBut the entire plot hinged on thecharacters NOT communicating.I had a thought towards the beginning of this book that if Zorie and Lennon just talked that the whole book would be over in 15 pages.AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF THE BOOK?That\\'s right. 400+ pages later and the two charactersfreaking finally communicatedand the book was 110% resolved within 15 pages.Unbelievable.Essentially, it definitely had good moments...just wasn\\'t a hit for me.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads'}, {'title': 'How to Walk Away', 'author': 'Katherine Center', 'summary': 'Margaret Jacobsen has a bright future ahead of her: a fiancé she adores, her dream job, and the promise of a picture-perfect life just around the corner. Then, suddenly, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life, everything she worked for is taken away in one tumultuous moment. In the hospital and forced to face the possibility that nothing will ever be the same again, Margaret must figure out how to move forward on her own terms while facing long-held family secrets, devastating heartbreak, and the idea that love might find her in the last place she would ever expect.', 'rating': '4.08', 'reviews': '“When you don’t know what to do for yourself, do something for somebody else”Sometimes a book comes along that makes my heart skip a beat. This is one of those times. I may not have come across this novel but a friend had just finished reading it and loved it. She thought I might enjoy it too.She was right. I loved it!Margaret Jacobsen has worked hard all of her life and things are starting to pay off. She’s dating an awesome guy, she’s going to be starting a great new job, and on a night out with her boyfriend, Chip, she has a strong feeling that things are about to get even better.We’ve all heard that saying that life can change in a moment, or the blink of an eye. And for Margaret, nothing could be truer when the greatest day of her life quickly turns into the worst day of her life. Her life is forever changed.“They say your life flashes before your eyes, but it wasn’t my life as I’d lived it that I saw. It was the life I’d been waiting for. The one I’d never get a chance to live.”“How to Walk Away” really was a fantastic read populated with so many awesome characters. Some good guys…some villains…but all well-developed and entertaining! Margaret is such a great character. Her personality won me over instantly. Her habit of filling the quiet with very strange but hilarious comments was just one of the things I loved about her.Heart-breaking one moment and laugh out loud funny the next (“Mes jambons sont eclatés” ).This was an incredibly inspiring read that made me look at a few things in my own life in a different way.Katherine Center writes with honesty and includes all of the messy parts. For me this was more than just a good story….it was fantastic! Strained relationships and family secrets, many things were easy to relate to. A story about strength, determination, love and so much more. The plot held my interest from start to finish and the characters captured my heart. I may have been able to see where things were going but the journey was just so much fun. Witty, loving, and optimistic, I started reading slower because I didn’t want it to end.“Carry the sorrow when we have to, and absolutely savor the joy when we can”I’m looking forward to reading whatever comes next from Katherine Center. She has written five other novels about love and family. You can bet I’ll be checking out those books out too.I\\'d like to thank St. Martin’s Press for giving me the opportunity to read this book in exchange for my honest review.The romance subplot in this book was an absolute 5 star winner.If you’re going through a big life change or something difficult, this book will both destroy and uplift you at the same time. So good luck! I loved it.*2.5 stars*Quotes alluding to a charming, witty and heartbreaking read from some of the heavy-hitters in the women’s fiction genre made picking upHow to Walk Awaya no-brainer for this reader. Finding the strength and tenacity to overcome a tragedy, along with a budding romance . . . how could this bleeding heart not love this book? Believe me, I tried. I really did.The approachKatherine Centertakes in telling Margaret’s story of perseverance is what I feel differentiates this book from so many others, but it also makes it sort of contradictory in tone. Margaret is a twenty-something on the brink of having everything she ever wanted and through no fault of her own, loses it all in one fell swoop. It’s quite devastating actually. Yet, the author opts for a fluff-fest, laden with self-help lines and a saccharine tone to brighten the mood. It was a bit much, even for this optimist.I’m guessing here, butI think the overly-positive approach to the topic driving this plot will divide readers.There will be those who undoubtedly appreciate the lightness the author brings to such heavy subject matter and there will be others—like myself—who struggle to connect emotionally and yearn for something deeper, more meaningful and authentic.Piecing together what happens after the major plot point is revealed is pretty simple, so I’m not going to dissect things here, but I will say Margaret’s new reality lacked some credibility. Not only were there inconsistencies surrounding her condition that seemed to take shape depending on the situation she found herself in, but the absence of any questioning on her part—especially in the beginning—felt off. It’s not a far stretch to thinkanyonein her situation would demand answers, immediately.What I found to be even more inauthentic was the dialogue, behavior and non-stop drama brought on by the secondary characters. They were not an easy bunch for me to like or even understand. The author relied heavily on their exaggerated antics to carry the story forward, which only served to highlight how weak the heart of the plot truly was. Compounded by the predictability, the author’s ease in glossing over pivotal points, the number of coincidences and that ending . . . do I even have to say it?How to Walk Awayhas not landed among my favorites.*Thank you to St. Martin’s Press for providing me with a review copy.4.5 stars for this one.When you can accurately predict nearly the entire plot of a book, yet you still can\\'t tear yourself away from it—that\\'s when you know you\\'ve found a good one.Margaret Jacobsen has always been an overachiever. She worked tirelessly to get good grades and succeed in school. She has been dating her handsome, steadfast boyfriend, Chip, for several years now, and she just landed her dream job, even though she wasn\\'t quite qualified. Everything is leading her up to the moment she\\'s been waiting for—she knows Chip is going to propose and they\\'ll begin their journey to happily ever after.Yet how often does everything turn out just as you\\'ve planned it? In a split second, perhaps the most magical moment in her life to date turns into her biggest nightmare, and she\\'s powerless to stop it. The next thing she knows, she wakes up in the hospital, having to face obstacles like she\\'d never imagined.\"We were the very definition of helpless, and as I realized that, it also hit me that everything I\\'d been looking forward to was over before it even began. Chip and me—and the lakeside wedding we\\'d never have, and the rescue beagle we\\'d never adopt, and the valedictorian babies we\\'d never make. They say your life flashes before your eyes, but it wasn\\'t my life as I\\'d lived it that I saw. It was the life I\\'d been waiting for. The one I\\'d never get a chance to live.\"Suddenly, the woman for whom everything has worked out perfectly has her whole life turned upside down. Yet at the very moment when all she wants to do is wallow, she has to deal with those around her as well. Chip is drowning in self-pity and wants Margaret to forgive him and give him the easy way out, without an ounce of sacrifice on his part. Her mother has taken on this challenge as she\\'s taken on every other obstacle in life—full steam ahead—and will stop at nothing to make her daughter fight to get every ounce of her life back and believe that is possible. Margaret\\'s sister Kit returns after a three-year absence, and tries to help her with her quirky sense of humor and her unflagging sense of enthusiasm.And then there\\'s Ian, Margaret\\'s physical therapist. The one the hospital staff thinks is too mean for Margaret\\'s wounded psyche. The only PT who doesn\\'t encourage or laugh with his patients, but instead just pushes them harder. The one who seems as if he feels nothing for anyone, except rage for his boss and the situation he\\'s found himself in.Margaret wants some semblance of her life back, but doesn\\'t know what that entails, and she doesn\\'t know how to handle those who purportedly know better than she does. How can she look forward to a life that will never be the same, never be what she had dreamed of? Will she even be able to have the things that \"normal\" people want—love, a family, a job, a future?\"I kept things calm, I stayed pleasant, I took my medicine—but the truth is, I had woken up in a dystopic world, one so different that even all the colors were in a minor key, more like a sour, washed-out old photograph than anything real. It looked that way, and it felt that way, too.\"From the very first pages,How to Walk Awaydrew me in. As soon as I figured out what was happening, I knew where the plot would go, and while at first I was a little frustrated, this book won me over almost immediately. These characters seem familiar yet they are so appealing, even when they\\'re acting selfishly, headstrong, impetuous, or insensitive. It didn\\'t matter that I knew what would happen from start to finish—I cared about these characters and needed to be part of their story.This is a book about finding hope and courage where you think you have none, about how you need to be the person to motivate yourself and buoy yourself through tough times—you can\\'t depend on those around you. It\\'s also the story of how it\\'s always great to have family and supporters and loved ones around, but you have to learn to do things for yourself, too.I\\'m being a little evasive with the plot even though many reviews explain just what happened to Margaret. I thought it was better to let the story unfold for you, even though you might very well predict it, too. This is tremendously appealing and so winning, that even when you wonder just how likely it would be that certain things would happen, you tell yourself to stop overanalyzing and keep enjoying.A book that tugs at your heartstrings and makes you talk to yourself: how can you ask for anything more? I can see a lot of people really loving this one.NetGalley and St. Martin\\'s Press provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review. Thanks for making this available!See all of my reviews atitseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 athttps://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html.3.5 Stars\"Sometimes the last thing you want is the one thing you need.\"At the beginning of the book, Margret Jacobsen was right where she wanted to be in her life. She had earned her MBA, she was about to start a dream job, and was in a relationship with the \"perfect man\". What could be better? Then on day, Chip, the perfect man, decided to take her flying. He knew that she was scared to fly, he knew that she had reservations, but he talked her into it. Never mind that although he is taking private pilot lessons and is so very close to getting his license - he was not a licensed pilot. He took out a plane and up they flew.What was supposed to be a romantic flight where they became engaged, turned into a nightmare. During landing they crashed, and Chip walked away without any injuries while Margret was not so lucky. In the hospital, she learned just how extensive her injuries are. She also learned some family secrets, faces heartbreak, copes with her medical situation and prognosis for her future. Her sister, Kit, who has been estranged form the family for several years, comes back into her life and provides a cushion for Margaret (Maggie) as she copes with her current situation, her parents, Chip, Chip\\'s Mother and her own feelings about her physical injuries. As she struggles with her physical therapy and her attempts to get a smile out of Ian, her physical therapist, we watch as she learns she still has a future, can still enjoy her life, and move on from past hurts.People show you who THEY are in how they treat you. During the course of her hospitalization and recovery, Margaret learns a lot about the people in her life through how they treat her and react to her injuries.A lot of research went into Margaret\\'s medical condition, burns, prognosis and physical therapy options. I did like how she is depicted as having various emotions during her hospital stay when learning of her injuries and her prognosis: shock, fear, hope, determination, worry, acceptance etc. I found that part to be realistic and made the book more enjoyable. She didn\\'t just initially accept things and move on, she needed support which she mainly received form her physical therapist and her sister. Yes, her parents were supportive as well, but I really enjoyed her relationship with her sister and her physical therapist.This was an enjoyable book about moving on, second chances, inner strength, family, acceptance and not giving up.Thank you to St. Martin\\'s Press and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.See more of my reviews atwww.openbookpost.com'}, {'title': 'Black Dagger Brotherhood #10Lover Reborn', 'author': 'J.R. Ward', 'summary': 'Ever since the death of his shellan, Tohrment has been unrecognizable from the vampire leader he once was. Physically emaciated and heartbroken beyond despair, he has been brought back to the Brotherhood by a self-serving fallen angel. Now, fighting once again with ruthless vengeance, he is unprepared to face a new kind of tragedy. When Tohr begins to see his beloved in his dreams—trapped in a cold, isolated netherworld far from the peace and tranquillity of the Fade—he turns to the angel in hopes of saving the one he has lost. But because Lassiter tells him he must learn to love another to free his former mate, Tohr knows they are all doomed.... Except then a female with a shadowed history begins to get through to him. Against the backdrop of the raging war with the lessers, and with a new clan of vampires vying for the Blind King’s throne, Tohr struggles between the buried past and a very hot, passion-filled future…but can his heart let go and set all of them free?', 'rating': '4.33', 'reviews': 'Verily, Ward, you hath redeemed thyself in mine eyes.Lover Unleashedwas disappointing for me on several levels. But I knew that, if Ward did it right, Tohrment\\'s book had the potential to be the best installment to the series in a long time. I\\'ve wanted him to find peace and healing ever since that fateful scene at the end ofLover Awakened, but I knew it would take time. And now that his time has finally come, I\\'m pleased to say that Ward doesn\\'t disappoint.Tohrment & No\\'One:I know a lot of people aren\\'t happy that Tohrment doesn\\'t get Wellsie back. I\\'m not happy about it, either. But save for getting Wellsie back, I believe Tohr was dealt the best hand possible inLover Reborn.Let me be frank: I had very little faith that Ward could pull a romance like this off. Seriously, Tohrment and Wellsie? Probably one of the most romantic couples I\\'ve ever come across in the PNR/UF genre. Their back story, the glimpses we see of their relationship in the first three books . . . how can you possibly follow an act like that?Some of the sentences in this are like an assault to the solar plexus. There were scenes where I felt like I was chopping onions. Suffice it to say I cried a lot while reading Tohr\\'s story. Man, Tohrment . . . he just . . . tears me apart. Truly.As Tohr says himself, No\\'One could never replace Wellsie; but the emotional — and physical — connection between Tohr and No\\'One is undeniable. Tohr and No\\'One have a lot in common (each has been through a tremendous ordeal in their lifetime), they\\'ve meant in the past and spent an entire year in each other\\'s company, and No\\'One is incredibly understanding and supportive of Tohr and his situation. I don\\'t think any other female could\\'ve brought him back from the brink the way No\\'One did.I didn\\'t expect to like No\\'One as much as I did — I\\'ve never really liked the Chosen women, and although No\\'One isn\\'t a Chosen, she\\'s very similar to them. But she is humble, kind, and, underneath the shield she\\'s erected to protect herself, passionate. Ward has surprised me before, and she definitely did in the case of No\\'One\\'s character.The best part about the romance in this is how slow it builds. One year passes from beginning to end of this installment, and Tohr doesn\\'t give himself over to the possibility of loving another easily. It isn\\'t until near the end that he truly opens his heart to No\\'One.But did you notice? No bonding scent. Save for a little show of possessiveness (which I think could just be chalked up to the nature of a male vampire), Tohr didn\\'t bond with No\\'One. I have to say that I liked this fact very much. For me, that would\\'ve discredited Tohr\\'s love for his previousshellanas well as the bonds the other Brothers have with theirshellans. I don\\'t think that the bonding thing should be taken lightly.Don\\'t get me wrong; I\\'m glad he\\'s in love with her and all, but I think him bonding with her would\\'ve been too much. I hope it doesn\\'t come into play in future books.Lassiter:Can somebody get me a bib? Seriously, you can have all of the Brothers (except Z, of course; I got dibs on him a long time ago), just give me Lassiter! God, he just gets more interesting — and sexy — with each book. And when his own book is finally released, I\\'ll be one of the first ones at the bookstore ready to trample over the other shoppers to get my copy.And something tells me his book is going to be very similar to Tohr\\'s and maybe even equally sad. If you\\'re observant and you\\'ve readHello, Old FriendandBook Orderin the Brothers on the Board section of the insider\\'s guide, then you know that Lassiter had a woman he loved who is now either missing or dead. There is also some hinting of that in this book. I don\\'t know if Ward will have him get her back, or have him end up with someone else. Since Ward seems to enjoy torturing her fans, it\\'ll probably be the latter.John & Xhex:Just as there was a lot of Vishous in Payne\\'s book (for obvious reasons), there is a lot of John and, naturally, Xhex in Tohr\\'s book. Their relationship gets tested and, similarly to Vishous and Jane inLover Unleashed, they go through a real rough patch. One of the things I like most about Ward\\'s couples is that, when their book is over, their story isn\\'t. There\\'ll always be new trials and new developments in her characters\\' lives.There are some really emotional — and erotic (seriously, they get twice as many sex scenes as the main couple) — scenes with John and Xhex in this. Fans of theirs should be very happy.And for John and Xhex, I\\'m sure the trials aren\\'t over. When Murhder finally gets into the series full-time, I\\'m sure he\\'ll shake things up quite a bit for them, as he is Xhex\\'s former lover. Can you saycohntehst?Qhuinn & Blay a.k.a. Qhuay (& Saxton and Layla, or as I like to think of them, The Third & Fourth Wheels):There isn\\'t much Qhuinn and Blay in this. :( Neither of them get much page time, because John and Xhex and the Bastardshog it alltake up the majority of the side story\\'s time. Still, there are some good scenes with them — both together and individually --- and theydosay absence makes the heart grow fonder. (Although I don\\'t see how I could get any more fond of those two . . .) On the plus side, there aren\\'t anylesserPOVs!Given the way chapter seventy-six ends . . . Qhuay\\'s story must be soon. Very soon. Whether it will be a novella or a full installment remains to be seen. All I can say is, if it turns out to be the former, it sure as hell better be tome-ish, anyway.So Qhuinn and Layla are going to have a child together, huh? I know it will infuriate many readers (I know it did me — at first), but at the same time I can see the beauty of it and the reason behind it.That little girl will be one of the most loved children you can imagine. She\\'ll have three parents — two fathers and a mother — and she\\'ll have the whole Brotherhood and theirshellansto care and love for her as well. It may not be ideal, and it may not be what a lot of readers had in mind for Qhuinn and Blay, but I can see the potential and beauty that this prospect holds. And I see why she wrote it this way. After Qhuinn was shunned by his family and the aristocracy, I think he deserves a full family. And this way, he\\'ll get to spend the rest of his life not only with the love of his life (Blay, naturally) and the Brotherhood, but a beautiful baby girl.Oh, Saxton . . . Ward has hinted as to what will become of him in a future installment, and I\\'m pretty sure I know what it is and that all of his fans (including myself) will not like it. Especially since inLover Rebornit becomes pretty clear that Saxton has fallen for Blay.As for Layla . . . well, I won\\'t give it away, but it is now very clear who Layla\\'s HEA is. And despite the fact that I\\'ve never been a big fan of Layla . . . I\\'m very much looking forward to her story. (This is really because of the male she ends up with. He is all kinds of hot.)Xcor! Xcor! Xcor! He may just end up being my favorite male character — next to Zsadist, of course.Which reminds me . . . The situation between Throe, Xcor, and Layla reminds me a bit of the one featured earlier in the series between Phury, Zsadist, and Bella. Phury had been attracted to Bella, had yearned for her, even; but in the end, his interest in her didn\\'t compare to the powerful, once-in-a-lifetime (especially for someone like Z) connection that Zsadist had with Bella. I believe it will be much the same for Layla and the two males who seek her out. And I\\'m sure Throe will eventually end up with someone else special. (Another Chosen, perhaps?)Band of Bastards:I predicted in my review ofLover Unleashedthat the B.o.B. (Band of Bastards) would most likely end up becoming good and each member would get their own book. Now . . . I still say that will happen, but I think it\\'s going to take a while. I think it would be a good idea, because without them Ward doesn\\'t have very many possibilities for future books. I think if it were ever to go in that direction, it would be a long time from now and a lot would have to happen in order for any of them to be ready for their own book. Ward actually talks about the B.o.B. in a YouTube video (specifically Xcor), which you can watchhere. (Turn up the volume if you wanna hear what she says)Oh please, please,pleasejust leave him alittlebit naughty . . . !Favorite Quotes:\"The quick and the dead are all the same. Everyone\\'s just looking for home.\"\"She wished for Qhuinn this soldier. She truly did.\"\"Then again, he supposed the healing process, in contrast to trauma, was gentle and slow . . .The soft closing of a door, rather than a slam.\"\"Our future has come.\"In short, I enjoyed this installment very much and I\\'m happy that Tohr is finally happy.Note: After I wrote my review, Ward announced who the next book will be about. If you want to know, click the spoiler.Qhuinn and Blay!!! Please seemy reviewof that book for more information.My reviews of other titles in this series:Lover UnleashedJust a fair warning: This book buttfucked me raw without lube (~*spoiler*~ pun intended) and destroyed my heartand sanity. My feelings are all over the place and I need to vent. Cursing, spoilers and inappropriate gifs ahead.TORH/NO\\'ONESummary: SEXSEXSEXSEXSEXSEXANGSTANGSTANGSTANGSTA year ago when Ward announced Tohr was next, I got so mad. It was too soon for him, it felt rushed, he wasn\\'t ready, she was fucking him up, etc. And sadly, I still stand on that.And on that note, let me clarify something: One thing is to accept someone you love died and to move on with your life and another is finding a new partner. You don\\'t need to fuck/love someone else to move on in a healthy way. I disagree completely with Ward here. Tohr needed to find himself again, move on naturally, accept Wellsie was death AND THEN find someone else. Not do both things at the same time.And honestly, Tohr was a douchebag to her for the most part. He treated No\\'One with no respect, insulted her and used her. Grieving doesn\\'t give you the right to act like that. And also: TOO MUCH SEX! If you know me, you know that coming from me is huge.The whole seasons thing was a weak plot device to be able to squeeze\\xa0a whole year worth development into one book, when each book usually covers like two weeks top. We\\'ve been getting Qhuay little by little over 5 books now, when that\\'s exactly what Ward should have done with Tohr/Autumn. Reading their developtment in 4-5 different books and then getting their own book would have worked better and more smoothly, IMO.But I guess Ward ran out of characters we currently care enough about to give a shit about a book with them as main characters. She\\'s got, what? The Shadows, the BoB, Muhrder, Lassiter (who she already stated needs to happen AFTER Tohr) and, oh yeah... Qhuay. But I guess 4 books were not enough built up for them...JM/XHEXFirst of all, you need to know I\\'m completely biased when it comes to these two. They are my favorite m/f couple. Xhex can do no wrong in my eyes, I\\'m her bitch and will always be. I stan them so hard they shouldfuckingadopt me.I read spoilers before reading the book and knew they had some problems. At first I thought, so soon?! WTF. But it made total sense. In fact, I\\'m glad this happened because someone had to make these warriors see women are more than soft, obliging creatures they own.I still believe John is the worst and most selfish BFF someone could have, but he\\'s one of the best boyfrands from the bunch of mated dudes we have in the series, IMO. I have a love/hate relationship with the handsome son of a bitch.XHEX (and the oppresion of men)Xhex was amazing, perfect, flaw free, better than your fave, best bias you can bias and the ultimate HBIC in this bookAGAIN.She stand in front of the whole Brotherhood and called them an\"anachronistic group of misogynists\", and very rightly so!She is greatly needed in this misogynist vamp society. You\\'re mated and suddenly all the males look at your mate for approval to let you do shit?! Horrible dejá vù of women not being allowed to open their own bank accounts for example without their husband\\'s signed permission. *shudders* I love the Brothers but they need to work on their close-minded view of females ASAP.Btw, during all her ordeal against theoppression of testosterone, where the fuck was Payne?AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THIS BS?The only female (Xhex) who seems to EVEN care about this general chauvinist behavior is constantly described as manly and masculine. Why can\\'t feminine women notice this and FIGHT AGAINST IT, too??Are Marissa, Mary, Ehlhenhah, Cormia, Bella or Beth grateful and content their mates let them get outta the mansion and do appropriate work for women?!Marissa thinking \"I\\'m so lucky, Butch is old fashioned but he never complained about me working\" made me want to punch her in the face. You may not see it, but that\\'s classic fucked up thinking for women in regards of their rights in society according to men. She is grateful her husband allows her to do as she pleases? Bitch, please. That thought should not exist in the first fucking place!And don\\'t get me started on the needing bullshit. \"Servicing\", my ass.LAYLAJ. R. Ward has ruined this character for me, verily. I can no longer stand to see her getting any kind of attention from any male, at all. My blood literally boils and I want to smack her. It\\'s irrational at this point.She possesses not a single redeeming quality IMO. You may be thinking, but she\\'s selfless and lives to service the warriors! If that is the case, let me direct you to my previous point. Layla is the worse example of women embracing chauvinism. Examples:\"Providing blood to males of worth was all that was left of her calling. All that she had in her life.\"\"Let us do what we must. For the future.\"Those are just a few of the little pearls of wisdom she presented us with in this book.Qhuinn has been \"educating\" her for months to see life is much more than just servicing men and wanting cock, and yet she\\'s still thinking exactly the same? Qhuinn, sts but yo wasting yor time, bud.Plus, is she dumb? No, seriously. I\\'m actually asking this for real. She\\'s been in the mansion for a few years now, right? She must know everyone who lives there, right? Plus, she\\'s been hunting for a mate so she must knowallthe males, right? And yet, she mistakes Xcor and Throe for BDB Warriors...? She didn\\'t notice anything shaddy when Throe called her in the middle of no fucking where? Or when sheneversaw them in the mansion after weeks of waiting? She so conviently never asked anyone about the warrior she had fed, either.And then, when she finds out who they truly are she faints, she is in distress, she can\\'t believe they fooled her... Oh poor,poorvictim of the cruel system. Note my sarcasm, please.She\\'s already started to bond with Xcor (pretty hardcorely, too) and the first backbone she shows is to betray him and help them TO KILL HIM?! She\\'s so worried about getting her servicing \"job\" taken from her, she\\'s ready to sell her mum if needed. Not even once did she try to convince them of some way out for the male she\\'s already fallen for.I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t respect her. She\\'s selfish, she wants wants wants and doesn\\'t think of consecuences or other people\\'s needs/feelings. She\\'s so selfish she wants a baby to feel better, FFS!!!Conclusion:XCOR/BoB/LAYLAMostly: Meh. I\\'m sad Ward is going to use this pontentially awesome HEA storyline in Xcor and Layla, tbh.The BoB started a bit zzZZzz but after Xcor betrayed Throe things picked up pace and turned interesting.The gay undertones between Xcor/Throe, Zypher/Throe, everyone/Throe were greatly appreciated. Throe is the glue keeping the Bastards together, everyone is his bitch! :DI\\'m also thinking ex-Aristocrat Throe and Super-Aristocra Saxton could be fun to read!QHUINNDuring the first half of the book, Qhuinn\\'s angst was so beautiful my heart ached for him. I\\'m not ashamed to admit I ugly cried when he got recognition from the Brothers.He is, however, a fucking dumbass. Can\\'t deny the truth. I love him, and bless his heart but he duuuumb. He needs to grow so much to be able to reach Blay. And don\\'t get me started on what a coward he is.Honestly, I\\'m mad at JRW for doing this to Qhuay. Not with Qhuinn.She made Qhuinn hold back his feelings because he thought he was not good enough for so long, and then she made him have a kid on a whim and change his mind about holding back with Blay on another.She spent 4 books building up his character, layer after layer, and it was so good!! And then idk, she went on crack? And ruined it all in a 30 secs decision. Just... WTF?Plus, maybe this is just me but... Since he is aware of his feelings for Blay now, shouldn\\'t he bemoreconcerned about not hurting him? Sure, he believes Blay has moved on and no longer cares about him (convenient plot device nº56730367) but when you love someone you obsess over silly things, such as, oh idk, \"I know Blay has moved on, but I used to hurt him with my whoring around. Maybe this still bothers him even when he\\'s happily mated with someone else and I should do something about it\"??Talk about not knowing how to properly pine for a person. Talk about dumbasses plot devices.QHUINN & LAYLA BFFsWhenever Qhuinn called Layla \"baby girl\" or touched her in any way, I got so mad at some point I realized I was projecting on Blay and getting all jealous and possessive. If I were Blay, after being mated, I couldn\\'t stand the thought of that bitch anywhere near us. Sorry, could never work for me... Even when Blay is a fucking saint, I can\\'t see it realistic for him to accept her in the middle of their marriage, especially after being hurt by Qhuinn\\'s slutty behavior for years. Blay is flaw free, but his confidence is touching rock bottom when it comes to Qhuinn. There has to be an issue about this between them or I call BS.But back at the unpleasant subject that are Qhuinn and Layla. I guess Ward was aiming at \"awww they are BFFs, how qt is that?!\" but sorry, couldn\\'t go there with them. Even Layla thinking she was over him sounded hollow and fake to my ears. It just didn\\'t make sense with the rest of her behavior. She\\'s pretty much the same after months of ~discovering the world~ and yet she has realized her feelings for Qhuinn weren\\'t real?Bitch pleaseanyone else?THE BIG OH NO, YOU DIDN\\'THDY JRW HFDY doesn\\'t even start covering it. She went there.She fucking went there.Already-bonded Layla and Bonded-for-3-Books-at-least Qhuinn decided the solution to all their issues was to have a kid together! Bringing a child to the world like it is a business transaction isnot right.The way she manipulated him into this was disturbing, too.“You’re my only hope, and I yours. … ”For someone playing so dumb about certain things (such as traitors) she was verily must cunning in convincing Qhuinn. She knew exactly what to say to use his issues and weak points against him.\"Let us do what we must. For the future.\"Oh yeah, the whole vampire race depends on you two! Now go populate the earth!I knew Qhuinn was a weak coward (see his relationship with Blay for examples) but my god, he went from \"I will NEVER have sex with her to prevent that Fade vision to happen\" to \"A child sounds like a fantastic idea and that Face vision assures it will happen!\" in less than 0.30 secs. *blinks a few times in confusion*Also: 1) No\\'One could barely talk when the needing hit her while Layla had a whole conversation with Qhuinn??? 2) Layla had been to the other side but not enough to get a free pass on the needing triggering??? 3) She decided to risk it and not freak out like the rest of the females *just in case*??? Pfffplease.And hey, WHERE THE FUCK WASPHURYWHEN THIS TRAIN WRECH HAPPENED?!They had isolated No\\'One and still, it seemed a porn movie was being filmed in the mansion while she was through her needing. And yet, when Qhuinn takes needing!Layla to his room, no one seems to notice or care enough to says \"OH WAIT SOMEONE IS DEFLOWERING A MOST VERILY SACRED CHOOSEN DURING HER NEEDING, DANGER, DANGER, PREGGO TIMES, DANGER.\"In vampire age, Qhuinn is a fucking kid. How come no one stopped them from making this huuuuge mistake?! Even Qhuinn thought Phury was going to kill him and yet, Phury was no where to be seeing. Not before, not during, not after. Perhaps Ward is holding those ~precious moment~ for the next book?I should have been glad they were awkward as fuck after it and clearly not ~in lurv~, but my god, this is such a huge mess I can\\'t even rejoice in the little mercies. And I\\'m assuming some people will be mad at Qhuinn for caring so much about her after it, but come on, IF this had to happen, he\\'d be an even bigger asshole if he didn\\'t act like this now, tbh.I still don\\'t undertand WHY Ward went there. I can\\'t see anyone being pleased with this. Qhuinn/Layla fans? (Legit question: Do they really exist?) \"Oh so romantic, they share a kid while they mate someone else.\" FRUSTRATED AND PISSED. Layla stans? \"My girl deserves respect and a male who worshippes only her!\" FRUSTRATED AND PISSED. Qhuay fans? Oh please, do I have to explain this one? FRUSTRATED AND ROYALLY PISSED.Conclusion:FUTURE DAUGHTERXhex:\"But why would they want a young? That shit was crazy town\"(There\\'s a good reason why Xhex is my fave!)^^^ Only shade of light in this mess is how IMO Ward showed the whole thing as something negative. The undertone was something along the lines of \"look at these two lost souls making a decision for the most fucked up of reasons\". That\\'s the only tiny positive thing on all this.This child is going to come to this world and be taken care of by a girl who lives in a fantasy world, unable to take care of herself, selfish and delusional and with a daddy so full of his own issues he\\'s nowhere near ready for any kind of responsability.And hey, congrats! Your step-dad is Xcor! Woohoo!I wish the kid wouldn\\'t exist... Well, scratch that. I wish Layla and her needing didn\\'t exist. But Qhuinn\\'s daughter? Sorry to say, I\\'m the biggest fucking sap in the world and I already love her. She\\'s fault-free and part of Qhuinn. #noregrets #comeatmebroBLAYBlaylock is, with Xhex, my favorite character. At this point I\\'m only invested in his happiness and fuck the world. He deserves only the very best, and maybe at this point some people believe Qhuinn doesn\\'t match that description (big surprise here), but Blay wants him and I want Blay to be happy, so I\\'m still pinning hard for Qhuay to happen.“I’m surprised … ” At how awful this felt.\"As that fucking chandelier twinkled overhead, Blay said roughly, “I’m still in love with him.”(GPOY of me while reading this scene)He broke my heart so much I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever recover from it. He is my most dearest character ever. And what\\'s happening to him is so unfair, in so many levels. Maybe he\\'s the character with the least tragic past or lesser issues, but my god, life is fucking him up royally over and over. When is it going to be enough for Ward\\'s standard of tortured men?! Even when he gets his man, he\\'ll have to share him with someone else. How fucking fair is that? For him, for Layla or for us.\"If he’d been able to, he’d have jumped up and torn that goddamn cocksucking light fixture off the goddamn cocksucking ceiling.\"If that didn\\'t cover perfectly well the general sentiment I don\\'t know what could. Blay losing it was so liberating. It was like I was losing itwithhim. About fucking time, too!SAXTONSaxton is a fucking saint. My creys. This male of worth deserves a good,long, thick cockhandsome, flawless male to service him for life.The fact that it was him who suggested Qhuinn should get some recognition for his brave actions was such a neat move. I can\\'t wait for Saxton and Qhuinn to have a stronger family bond. #sapAnd yet... Why the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu- did he stop Blay when he tried to storm out the room? Maybe he was headed to Qhuinn\\'s room to stop that madness from happening!!!!!! Am I the only one who yelled NOOOOOOOOO?BLAY/SAXTONBLAY BUTT-FUCKED SAXTON WITHOUT LUBE!!!!!!!Sorry, I *had* to say it. For a moment it was like reading a yaoi comic, where men always have self-lubricating bottoms. Hopefully this was an out of the moment thing and Ward knows this is not the norm for future references. Or maybe she pulls a \"gay vamps can self-lubricate themselves at will *poker face*\"…? You never know!Still, not enough details. I know, none HEAs don\\'t get sex screen time, but hey, someone remembers that sympath bitch and Rehv? Hmmm... yeah.MY DEAREST QHUAY *CHEST HURTS*I\\'m actually so disappointed in Ward. I used to believe in her. I trusted her. 100% But she\\'s been dragging out their story for too long and adding ridiculous plot devices to hold them back. Don\\'t bullshit me anymore with \"they aren\\'t ready\". They are and they were. You made Torh be ready and stuffed a whole year into a book to make it happen, so STFU and give us Qhuay already!Onto more fangirling comments: Qhuinn\\'s physical reaction when his stare met Blay\\'s was so intense I forgot to breath for a moment.And I guess we\\'re going for full circles here. First Blay told Qhuinn he loved him and Qhuinn didn\\'t hear him (very convenient) and now Qhuinn told Blay he loved him, and very conveniently again, Ward used John\\'s self-centered character to mistake the tone and who Qhuinn was talking to, to cockblock Qhuay ONCE AGAIN.There has been so much cock-blocking between these two, I\\'m glad they are both males or they wouldn\\'t know what a penis looks like anymore at this point.When Qhuinn was injured, they were so heartbreaking, so clearly in pain and longing for each other. It\\'s exaclty what I needed. But then, Blay believes that angsty tear is because Qhuinn is in pain and is about to leave, Qhuinn calls his name and he ignores him?! You love someone, and no matter how much that person rejected you, if they call you like that in a moment of need/being hurt, you turn around and see what they want. No, seriously, stop with the stupid cock-blocking!!!!And yet, when Jane is like wtf at Blay, another cock-block happens with Saxton holding him back outside the room. Can we please be done with the delay already? Those are just weak, weak, weak excuses. And I\\'m tired of them.I\\'ve seen lots of people discussing what those two things that had to happen for Qhuay to be ready were, and my two cents are: Blay\\'s reaction to Qhuinn/Layla during her needing, and Qhuinn realizing life is too short and you can lose your loved ones in a moment.WHO IS NEXTDuh:\"As Blay started to straighten, like a message had been received, Qhuinn thought \\'That\\'s right, buddy. Our future has come…\\'\"Side Note: Qhuinn, you stupid fuck, you just got a girl pregnant and NOW you decide to go after Blay?!!?!EDIT: March 31 2012\"THEIR TIME HAS COME. 2013- NEXT BDB HARDCOVER…..BLAY & QHUINN!!!!\"Note:The gifs posted here keep getting exceeded bandwidth with too many views. omg guise… What are y\\'all doing? :__)(Spoilers are hidden)“The quick and the dead are all the same.Everyone’s just looking for home.” - LASSITERHear ye! Hear ye!Leteth it be known that on this day, March 31st, 2012, I solemnly vow that I shall never doubt the WARDen again!So, now thatthat\\'sout of the way, my thoughts on the book...I wasn’t sure she could do it.Pffffft!Silly me.I didn\\'t think she could pull it off.*sigh*Whatever was I thinking?And had I had actually considered skipping this book and not reading it at all? Yes, yes I had.*hangs head in shame*In fact, I\\'ve spent the past year angsting and fretting and worried and crying and angry… and over what? That Wellsie would be replaced? That the whole ‘Wellsie can’t move on until you do…’ storyline would feel too contrived? That I\\'d have to sit through more Qhuay drama than any human being should be forced to endure? Yes, in fact, I worried about all of those things and much, much more, but like I told my Goodreads friends in the JR WARD BLACK DAGGER BROTHERHOOD GROUP, never, ever, will I doubt the WARDen again!Okay, let\\'s get down to business...spoiler thoughts:Tohr and Autumn and their story:I honestly wasn\\'t sure what to think about No\\'One because we\\'d never been given enough of her character to form any real impressions. I\\'m thrilled to say that I think she\\'s all kinds of awesome! I loved that she didn\\'t try to hide behind her mistakes, that she came out, faced them, admitted to them, and did everything she could to make things right.And Tohr... what a male of worth! Amazing, honorable, hot... But wow... I felt so much pain for him. The WARDen did a great job, I think, of showing that it was not easy for him to let go. That it tore him apart to even think about it. In this one book I was able to feel what he\\'d been living for the past years since Wellsie\\'s death, and I needed to feel those emotions in order to buy this story.This was a tough one for me, because I was very upset, very worried about Wellsie being replaced, worried that it would be a \\'they were never meant to be\\' couple... but I think the WARDen did a fantastic job of handling a difficult subject and she did it with compassion, understanding, and a great deal of love and respect all the way around.That\\'s not to say that I\\'m not sad still. Even after I finished the book, I cried for Tohr and Wellsie, and their baby, Tohrment, son of Tohrment, and for all that had been taken from them. I\\'m truly not sure if I\\'ll ever be okay with it, but it is what it is.John Matthew and Xhex:I always thought it was a little easy for JM to accept Xhex as a fighter. It just seemed too simple for a bonded male to be able to send his mate out into the field and be okay with it. That\\'s why their story in Lover Reborn, I felt, was perfect. We finally were able to see how JM really felt, and how his feelings affected Xhex. I really appreciated this glimpse into their relationship and am thrilled for the way things worked out for them.The Band of Bastards:I can\\'t say enough about them. I hated them, despised them, sat imagining all kinds of horrible ways to kill them, and loved every single minute of it! I can\\'t wait to read more, especially about Xcor. He\\'s the Bastard I\\'m most excited about!Assail:Hot damn! I\\'m digging Assail... I wonder if he\\'s part Sympath and that\\'s how he and Xhex knew each other?! He\\'s a male to watch!Qhuinn and Blay:Over the years I\\'ve become ambivilant about their story. I had reached the point where I just wanted their book so it would end already... be put out of my misery! I thought if I had to spend even a moment more watching their crap I\\'d rather drink bleach!!!Yes, well, that\\'s all changed. In one scene of several paragraphs, Qhuinn took me from loathing them to adoring them, and I am so, so stoked that their book is next!!!!Layla:I still say she\\'s a female of worth who\\'s just misunderstood.The epilogue:You can\\'t get much more Harlequin Presents than this without changing publishers.What made this book all kinds of brilliant...The entire message of this book is summed up by Qhuinn, in one of the best, most poignant scenes of any Black Dagger Brotherhood book ever, and had me throwing fist punches and shouting, “YES!!!” -All that simple-and-easy ended as he turned around. In the library, through the open doors, he saw Blay and Saxton talking. And then his cousin stepped in and pulled Blay into his arms. As the pair of them stood together, body on body, Qhuinn took a deep breath and felt a little death of his own come to him.He guessed this was how it ended for them.Separate lives, separate futures.Hard to think that they had started outinseparable—Abruptly, Blay’s blue stare found his.And what Qhuinn saw in it caused him to falter: Love shone out of that face, unadulterated love untempered by the shyness that was very much a part of his reserve.Blay didn’t look away.And for the first time… neither did Qhuinn.He didn’t know whether the emotion was about his cousin—it probably was—but he’d take it: He stared right back at Blaylock and let everything he had in his heart show in his face.He just let that shit fly.Because there was a lesson in this Fade ceremony tonight: You could lose the ones you loved in the blink of an eye—and he was willing to bet, when it happened, you weren’t thinking about all the reasons that could have kept you apart. You thought of all the reasons that kept you together.And, no doubt, how you wished you’d had more time. Even if you’d had centuries…When you were young, you thought time was a burden, something to be discharged as fast as possible so you could be grown-up. But it was such a bait-n-switch—when you were an adult, you came to realize that minutes and hours were the single most precious thing you had.No one got forever. And it was a fucking crime to waste what you were given.Enough, Qhuinn thought. Enough with the excuses, and the avoidance, and the trying to be someone, anyone else.Even if he got shanked, even if his precious little ego and his dumb-ass little heart got shattered into a million pieces, it was time to stop the bullshit.It was time to be a male.As Blay started to straighten, like a message had been received, Qhuinn thought, That’s right, buddy.Our future has come.And the future doesn\\'t get better than that!One final thought...And in closing, I feel the need to point out that I\\'m thrilled that I am not the one who has to change the sheets in the Brothers\\' rooms at the Mansion. You couldn\\'t pay me enough.Just sayin\\'....5 stars – Paranormal/Vampire/UF RomanceThoughtsBeforeReading:When will the WARDen give us Qhuinn’s/Blaylock’s story, dammit?!?!? I don’t give a @*#&$ about Tohr!?I want Qhuay!!!!ThoughtsAfterReading:This is me coughing up feathers after eating crow becauseLover Rebornwassooomuch better than I expected. It’s an emotional read that had me shedding serious tears and an a+wesome installment to the series!And now that the Warden has officially announced on Facebook that Blay and Qhuinn are the next BDB hardcover release slated for 2013?!?!*faints*Seriously, somebody better have a stash of smelling salts handy!WithLover Reborn, Ward partly redeems herself for last book. I can\\'t say she\\'s back to her old level though. To me, the book was a 4 star start and a 2 star finish. There were lots of okay moments, some very beautiful moments and some seriously contrived, idiotic and redundant moments. So I ended up with 3 stars.Despite this I think this book came too soon and didn\\'t do justice to Tohr, his needs, and his relationship with neither Wellsie or No\\'One. More on that later, I\\'m going to start with the good.The fab:The first 50% of the book.Honestly: I was pleasantly surprised. After the disappointment that wasLover Unleashed, I wasn\\'t expecting much, so I started reading with a “you better show me what you\\'ve got”- attitude. But my reserve and cynicism slowly but surely changed to interest. Then engagement. And then finally I was back to where I was with the old BDB books: holding my breath, ooh-ing and aah-ing and giggling.Contrary to my expectations: Ward excelled in the low action parts. The quiet moments, the beautiful scenes of (platonic) intimacy, the gradual change in the feelings of characters... It was all wonderfully done. I never expected for Ward to make Tohr and No\\'One even remotely interesting but she did more than that: she made it so that -for the first half of the book- I didn\\'t doubt their connection. Those two just worked together. The way their relationship evolved in the first half of the book: from hostility to truce, to acknowledging their similarities, to tentative companionship, to a true connection... it just made sense. Tohr and No\\'One together made sense. Without taking anything away from what Tohr had with Wellsie. Tohr\\'s feelings of guilt and remorse, his contradictory thoughts and physical responses... there were some beautiful scenes in there.Lassiter and Qhuinn. Each time I got to read a POV of one of these boys, I got a smile on my face.The interesting:Assail. Ward dubbed him Tha Shit so my expectations were high. I can\\'t say he met them, but his story line is certainly promising.The Band of Bastards. After the sap out in last book, I was dreading more Xcor and BoB scenes, but turns out they\\'re still interesting and edgy. Of course, it\\'s clear that all them bad boys are just darlings inside, but for now I\\'m resolved to enjoy their moral ambiguity. Oh, and I\\'m really curious about those unnamed cousins!The missed opportunity:Xhex and No\\'One\\'s relationship. There was one scene of importance between Xhex and No\\'One. And, beautiful as it was, it wasn\\'t enough. Not only do I think that one conversation can\\'t rekindle a mother/daughter relationship (especially for two people who have never had a normal relationship in their lives), but the fact is: here we have two strong, smart females, with a difficult past who are going to difficult times and this is what we get? Such a waste!The meh:The second half of the book. There were just too many obvious plot devices (Tohr having to come to talk to No\\'One while in her needing), inconsistencies (two needings being handled completely differently) and huh-moments (Qhuinn and Xcor fist fighting while fully armed, Payne\\'s magic hand being completely overlooked in heavy medical situations). I know it\\'s little things but it adds up to being very annoying. I don\\'t want to feel like my intelligence is insulted while I\\'m reading a book.The JM/Xhex story line. I was afraid those two would become forLover Rebornwhat V and Jane were forLover Unleashed: a contrived story line with out of character actions, solely created to add to the drama.Well: it wasn\\'tthatbad. First of all it was wonderful to be in JM\\'s head again, and the sex was HOT. Furthermore: especially in the beginning, I could relate to both characters; both to their rational and irrational behavior. But as their story line progressed, the way Xhex and JM handled their problems made no sense at all.Also: as annoying as the V/Jane, subplot was, at least it weaved into the main plot. It wasn\\'t the case for JM and Xhex. To me, this made that -at a certain point- their story line not only felt silly, but also completely redundant.The second part of the Tohr/No\\'One story line:The first half of the love plot was so beautifully done that I was rooting for them despite my initial reservations. They had an undeniable connection which was based as much on their current dynamics as their shared history together. I was really curious how this connection would gradually grow into full blown love. Well: it didn\\'t. I felt like their relationship made a huge leap, which wasn\\'t founded in the way interacted. Everything which made their connection promising in the first half, was gone in the most part of the second. Tohr and No\\'One\\'s relationship was based on openness. They talked. They related. That\\'s what brought them together: they were friends before lovers. That companionship was absent in the last part. I understand the need for drama and angst, but it didn\\'t make the falling in love-part believable.The bad:The premise of the love plot: Wellsie being stuck in the In Between didn\\'t make sense at all. Not only did it go against everything Ward has said and published about Wellsie (on her old boards, there used to be a scene of Wellsie talking to Tohr about being in the Fade), but the fact that it was Tohr\\'s task to let her go so she could be at peace goes against the basics of Ward\\'s world. The world in where mated vampires devote their lives to their shellans. Tohr is mated to Wellsie for 200 years and he is supposed to just get over it within 1,5 years? Is he not supposed to mourn?Also: why was Wellsie sent to the In Between right off the bat if it\\'s a case of \\'prolonged mourning that’s not allowed? In that case: Tohr wasn\\'t even allowed a mourning period of a millisecond.The ugly:Layla: It almost feels like revenge to combine the words \\'Layla\\' and \\'ugly, because if I hear one more time how unearthly beautiful and perfect she is, I\\'ll break something.This girl must be one of the most annoying characters in PNR history. And no: I\\'m not just saying that because of her Qhuinn-hang up. She is just poorly characterized. We are supposed to root for her happiness and feel sorry for her sorrow. I just want to knock some sense into her. No she isn\\'t naive and she isn\\'t strong. She is self serving, dumb and pig headed. Her actions in the book spoke volumes. I\\'m already pissed that she\\'s going to fuck up Xcor\\'s book...The kid: Apparently Layla\\'s stupidity was contagious. The joint decision (because sorry people: however stupid and unfounded, at the end it was that: a joint decision) was made on a whim and had me going QHUINN, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKING?!?! I\\'m pissed because I wanted Qhuinn and Blay to start out their relationship with just each other. They had enough problems as it is. Alas, no such thing.So all in all,Lover Rebornwas an okay book, which had the potential to be much better. But I\\'m happy to say that Ward has restored some of my faith in her. So she better not mess it up next book (finally: Qhuinn and Blay, baby!).'}, {'title': 'The Rules of Scoundrels #4Never Judge a Lady by Her Cover', 'author': 'Sarah MacLean', 'summary': 'She is the most powerful woman in Britain, A queen of the London Underworld...But no one can ever know.He is the only man smart enough to uncover the truth, Putting all she has at risk...Including her heart.The fourth book in New York Times bestselling author Sarah MacLean’s incredible Rule of Scoundrels/Fallen Angels series.

I can\\'t.Here\\'s the thing. Once upon a time a young girl was seduced, under the pretenses of true love, marriage and happily-ever-after. Of course, nothing like that happened, the girl is ruined and pregnant at sixteen. She is despised by everyone, condemned, they\\'re calling her a whore and whatnot. It\\'s the nineteenth century after all. If you\\'re a girl, you better be a virgin or you can drop dead, nobody would care.So this girl vows revenge on everyone, they are all going to pay for the way they mistreated her and her daughter. She creates this alter ego, pretends to be a man and manages to fool the whole world.Chase, her alter ego, is smart, wise, ruthless, cunning, and with her three partners she creates an exclusive gaming hell where all the aristocrats who once made her life living hell, now lose their fortunes and respectability. She creates another version of herself, Anna the prostitute (she isn\\'t really a prostitute), so she can monitor everything that happens in the gaming hell from the front rows.Ten years later, she is the ultimate puppeteer. She has all the threads in her hands. Chase is one of the most powerful men in London. The king has nothing on him. But now, her real self needs a respectable husband, so that her daughter has a shot at normalcy. And here\\'s what makes no sense to me.Everyone, I mean everyone, knows of your scandal, knows your daughter is a bastard (it\\'s the same as with non-virgins, if you\\'re a bastard, you just better drop dead, no one cares about you) and yet you still insist on marrying a viscount, thinking that somehow this marriage will save your daughter. How? You think she\\'s gonna find a family where that won\\'t be held over her head? It\\'s roughly the Victorian era, people are judgemental hypocrites, it will not be easy on her, any way. Logic flaw aside, she doesn\\'t even love that viscount (and it was strongly hinted he might be gay). She is in love with the second most powerful man in London (after her ofc) , the newspaper magnate, Duncan West. Plenty of drama ensues.My god, you would think that a woman who rises from the ashes with no one\\'s help, all on her own, is a strong, confident, brave woman, who takes life by the balls and allows no one to tramp on her. Yeah, no.Georgiana is a wuss.She is insecure, she is a coward, she is a friggin sheep and Duncan her sheppard. She allows him to blackmail her, to humiliate her, to disrespect her, to push her around.She is pathetic.Duncan on the other hand is a lying hypocrite with a hero complex. Apparently he wanted Anna for a long time, but she a ho, so no go. Only when he found out she\\'s really Georgiana, a daughter of a duke, he\\'s after her, wants to save her from that awful life in that gaming hell. Duncan requests that Georgiana gives up all her secrets so he can protect her from Chase, who is using her and who is terrorizing her, while in the meantime he evades every question she asks.Georgiana explicitly says that her relationship with Chase is not like that, not even sexual, but Duncan won\\'t hear it, because she\\'s a stupid female, what does she know about anything. She needs rescuing and that\\'s it.Dear god, this story had so much potential! Imagine a power play between the two most important people in London, while battling an ever-growing attraction to each other. Imagine them realizing that battling is counterproductive, and then unifying their forces to beat every one of their enemies. Imagine them living as equals, being a family and just enjoying what life has to offer.That would be something worth reading.Read and decide for yourself. As for me, I\\'ve outgrown this kind of stories.Never Judge a Lady by Her Covermight have been once a tolerable read, but like everything in this world, my reading tastes have evolved.The end of the scoundrel series. Sniff! As ever, take my review with a grain of salt!My theory on who Chase is..Spoiler Alert!To find the answer, one must start at the beginning.The link between Love by Numbers and The Rule of Scoundrels is Lady Penelope Marbury.Ten years ago, Lady Penelope, whom now is the marchioness of Bourne (from Rules of a scoundrel), was once plagued by a broken engagement. An engagement which was sought after by the\\xa0Duke of Disdain, or otherwise known as the Duke of Leighton (from Love by Numbers).\\xa0The duke was desperate to do what he must to protect his own. To link his dukedome to the daughter of a double marquess -a bond he\\xa0thought would withstand any scandal. His sister\\'s scandal - Lady Georgiana - \\xa0to be precise.However, the scandal , which was announced in the papers (cue in Mr. West?) dissolved his engagement to Lady Penelope and insured his freedome to marry his love, Ms. Juliana Fiori.Lady Georgiana is the epitome, the very definition of a fallen angel. At the age of 17, the daughter of a duke gives birth to an illegitimate girl. Her fall from polite society an inevitable consequence. Her acceptance within the folds of a less-acceptable society a foregone conclusion. \\xa0Her link between the two parts of society, and her stay at a house for women, the discarded members of the ton - along with their secrets -, makes her a perfect candidate for the all-knowing, the secret keeper, Chase - \\xa0Founder of the Fallen Angel.The reference of the Fallen Angel was first mentioned in Love by Number...“And it was enough for Georgiana. The path forked ahead of them, and she threaded one hand through Juliana’s arm, leading the way back to the house. “Never fear, Juliana. When my news gets out, they will forget everything they have ever thought of you and your mother. Fallen angels make for excellent gossip.”“But you are the daughter of a duke,” Juliana protested. “Simon is marrying to protect you.”Excerpt From: MacLean, Sarah. “Eleven Scandals to Start to Win a Duke\\'s Heart.” HarperCollins, 2011-04-01. iBooks.This material may be protected by copyright.An interesting conversation between Cross and Chase reveals that Chase is indeed a SISTER to someone - a sister who refuses the help of her brother. (which is true for lady Georgiana )“She wants nothing to do with me. Even when I told her I would take care of Knight, she had little to say. She didn’t believe me.”Chase was quiet for a long moment, considering the situation. “Sisters are difficult. They do not always respond well to the dictates of older brothers.”“You would know that better than anyone.”Excerpt From: MacLean, Sarah. “One Good Earl Deserves a Lover.” HarperCollins, 2013-02-01. iBooks.This material may be protected by copyright.Descriptions of Chase raising a blonde or \"golden\" eyebrow - mannerisms which both the Duke of Leighton and his sister Lady Georgiana had.There is without a doubt that the lady whom Lady Pippa speaks with at the hell is Georgiana, and when said lady interacts with Cross, we also know this lady has to be Chase.\\xa0This lady\\'s \\xa0( Georgiana ) interaction to the owner of almost all of London\\'s papers, \\xa0Mr. Duncan West, points to an enigmatic yet thrilling romance. How interesting to think that the vessel to her public ruination (an article in a newspaper) led to her self inflicted \\xa0fall, and its owner may lead her to love.This book can\\'t come soon enough....FINALLY!

Heartbreaking one moment, uplifting the next, and burn up the pages passionate yet another, start to finish Duncan and Georgiana grabbed hold of my heart andstill, a couple months after reading their story, they haven\\'t let go. Theirs is a romance for the ages, and I\\'m so very glad Sarah MacLean gave it to us.To say I was captivated is to say the least, and to say I\\'ll miss the world of The Fallen Angel is putting it mildly. Thankfully Sarah MacLean is a master at telling a story and I have no doubt I\\'ll love whatever tale she tells next.An ARC was generously provided by Avon Books, and to show my appreciation and gratitude I\\'m giving them an honest review.Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.I had been looking forward to this book. I was so excited that I figured out the secret of Chase in the first book in the series. There was one thing I didn’t realize, but it didn’t really matter ultimately. Not much was done with it ... like so much else in this story.What we got was pages and pages of repetitive inner monologue from both leads. This book was so padded I don’t think the actual action would have made enough text for a novella. It’d be a short. I skimmed tons. It was the only way to get through it.The premise is fine. In fact it has great potential. But that potential was never fulfilled. I was so annoyed by the end I almost DNF’d at about 80%.Georgiana is a powerful duke’s sister who is shunned by society because of her illegitimate daughter. We see the circumstances that brought that about in the prologue and it certainly is a scene that makes the reader think, “this is gonna be good!” But then we settle in to a “romance” where two people are keeping major secrets from one another (and one of them is keeping secrets from the reader as well) and spending the vast majority of their encounters with one another thinking about how they’d love to be together forever but they simply can’t because of SECRET! They don’t SAY these things. They THINK them. Because THINKING them is so much more romantic than SAYING them to one another. Because if they SAID them to one another then the story might actually MOVE past square one.In the final 18% of the book, we had all the action that had been avoided throughout the first 82%. Sometimes -- rarely, but sometimes -- that leads to a satisfying conclusion. By that point, though, I was pissed off. And the sudden activity/conclusion caused the story to be wrapped up neatly in quick strokes like a term paper written 20 minutes before class begins. Yes, that happens often, but this is the final book in a successful series. Some care needs to be taken with closers and MacLean simply did not pull it off.So, I was going to give it 2 stars, but I’ve decided to give it 1. I rarely do that, but writing this review has caused me to be pissed off again, so I can’t even give it two stars for the potential these two characters had at the beginning. It was all wasted and that just made the whole thing worse.'}, {'title': 'Lux #4Origin', 'author': 'Jennifer L.

Each breath she took, I felt in every part of my body, in some areas more than others. Really inappropriate, but she always had a powerful hold over me. Common sense jumped out the window.”Warning: this contains foul language and also tiny spoilers!!!For those of you who don\\'t know what this book is about: this book is about rubbing and also groping.There were literally 3 chapter about them (ahem) enjoying each-other! 3 CHAPTERS noting happened except them lying in bed! and then there were 2 more of them walking through Vegas and thinking about FEELINGS.There might have been some descent action scenes somewhere around the end, but I was so fed up of this book by then, i skip-read through most of them.The thing is, this series starts off well. You have the first, maybe even the second book, and it has its eye-rolling moments but they are neatly dispersed through the book and cut of just before you start cringing. So you finish it and you like it and you are a little ashamed to admit because of its cheesy plot but you give it 4 stars anyway and wait for the next book excitedly.And here is where everything goes spiraling downward. Why i think that is?First The behavior of the characters was unrealistic. I kept in mind that we (people) act differently in stressful situations but i can\\'t imagine anyone acting the way our two MC did at the beginning. Kidnapped by the Government, tortured, scared for their life one would want comfort and closeness from their loved one not penetration. (i\\'m being vulgar on purpose - this book violated my mind. i\\'m in for revenge!)Second the plot is stretched to tin, the story is not that complex to be divided in 5 parts. This would have been decent enough series if it was only 3 books.Third the so-called LOVE they feel for each-other its noting more then hormones and hornyness (that\\'s not a word - i don\\'t care). It might pass as obsession, lust, craving, maybe crush.... But never LOVE. You don\\'t apologize to the one you love about your feelings. They are a part of you. You don\\'t say \"thank you\" just because they stays after you cried. That\\'s what they SHOULD do, its not special and its not exclusive. It\\'s what you DO for the one you LOVE. And you say what you want, without thinking too much about it, because that\\'s you unfiltered - and that\\'s the ONLY YOU they should know and love!And Last...We have this author, and she would not go in to history with the greatest, but she is good enough for our generation. And she writes in cliches but that\\'s OK, because people that don\\'t read as mach as WE do, love them - also they sell. And she is writing Young Adult and she also writes New Adult. And I think somewhere along the way she stopped seeing the line between the two.And this Book is the result.I read through all of this book waiting for the love i felt for its predecessors to come back. It never did. This book might have tainted the whole series form me. I now wonder how i read any of them at all?So NO! I didn\\'t like this book! And YES I am gonna read the last one because i came this far and i want to see how it ends! And YES i feel a little like a hypocrite because of it! (and a little sick when i remember that i have to read about their FEELINGS again!)My recommendation?! If you are not as cynical as i am you might like this one and If you are not as old as i am then you might love this one. If you are bout of those things (and also have a brain and opinions) i don\\'t recommend it!(for the ones who decide to read this after all): Just be prepared for the touches and the kisses and the legs spreading and gasps and growls while the people are dying around them.!!!!Because they love each-other people, that\\'s why!!!!--------------------*I hid the teasers I posted earlier under spoiler-tag!

This afternoon, her planet was invaded.The year is 2575, and two rival mega-corporations are at war over a planet that’s little more than a speck at the edge of the universe. Now with enemy fire raining down on them, Kady and Ezra — who are barely even talking to each other—are forced to evacuate with a hostile warship in hot pursuit.But their problems are just getting started. A plague has broken out and is mutating with terrifying results; the fleet’s AI may actually be their enemy; and nobody in charge will say what’s really going on. As Kady hacks into a web of data to find the truth, it’s clear the only person who can help her is the ex-boyfriend she swore she’d never speak to again.Told through a fascinating dossier of hacked documents — including emails, maps, files, IMs, medical reports, interviews, and more — Illuminae is the first book in a heart-stopping trilogy about lives interrupted, the price of truth, and the courage of everyday heroes.', 'rating': '4.24', 'reviews': 'DNF at 30%This book is written in epistolary format, and it has the honor of beingthe most annoying book I\\'ve read this year. Some people love that stuff. I ain\\'t one of them. I love space shit. Firefly. Star Wars (yes, EVEN THE NEWER ONES). Star Trek (I loved Enterprise and I don\\'t care who knows it). This book was just terrible and terribly formatted.The first few chapters are entirely interviews. It was annoying as shit. It didn\\'t endear me to the main characters, and it explain nothing. Interviews are nigh on useless for building a memorable introduction, unless it is in the hands of an extremely skilled writer. Not the case here.So right off we have an annoying girl who\\'s thinking about her ex bf when the invasion occurred (huh?). I have no idea where we are. I have no idea what year it is. I don\\'t know what a Kerenza whatever is.Interviewer: Wait, you people had a subway system? I thought this settlement was illegal?Ezra Mason: Chum, the Kerenza mine operated undetected for twenty years. Whole families lived there. You know how far from the Core we are, right?WHAT. THE. FUCK. IS. GOING. ON?Bad start. And it didn\\'t get much better. After what seems like 10000000 pages of interviews, all of a sudden we\\'re at war (still no idea where we are, what year it is, how we got here, etc.) and then young people are getting conscripted for the military.Anyone showing C-grade ability or better is to be conscripted the day they hit eighteen. We need pilots. We need gunners. We need spanner monkeys and chipheads. And we need them now.This is an unprecedented situation—to my knowledge, no stellarcorp has ever openly attacked a United Terran Authority ship. I don’t care if BeiTech Industries’ litigation department has enough red tape to gift-wrap a small moon. These corporations need to learn nobody is above the law and nobody attacks a UTA vessel without consequences.Yay.There are battle ships and specs of battle ships.Do I give a fuck? No, I don\\'t. There are cool pictures. There are snippets of things I couldn\\'t give two shits about. What I want is a sensible story, and I didn\\'t get that here. I got a headache instead.By 30%, I still have no idea what the fuck is going on. I concede, my brain prefers structure. If you\\'re into this stuff, good for you. It\\'s just not for me.Visually,Illuminaeis an extremely fun and unique kind of book. It\\'s a romantic space opera told through a collection of interview transcripts, diary entries, emails and gorgeous space images like this:Sounds amazing, no? If I was rating solely based on cool ideas, this would get a bajillion stars.A book this attractive should not be boring and yet the most exciting things about it - by far - were the unusual style and graphics. The story itself - of a planet being invaded in 2575 - simply didn\\'t hold my attention. I found myself wanting to skim read many of the pages. Maybe it was because the lovers at the centre of the novel were boring caricatures of teenagers.Maybe it was because of the detailed scientific descriptions and diagrams of spaceships:Maybe it was the tiresome and dull \"Unipedia\" pages that made me feel like I was studying for an essay:But mostly I think it was because of the teens in love. Kady embodies the definition of a \"strong heroine\" but doesn\\'t actually have a personality beyond that. Her entire characterization is built around badass girl power and I almost want to love that fact, but she never felt like a person. She felt like a cardboard cutout delivering snarky toughness.The conversations between her and Ezra feel forced, like someone reading off a script:It\\'s the kind of book that looks way better from far away.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|YoutubeILLUMINAE is the classic tale of Girl Meets Boy:Girl Loses Boy:And Parents:And Planet:and Ends Up on a Crippled Spaceship:with a Mad Computer:and a Deadly Virus Outbreak:in the Middle of an Interstellar War:It\\'s without a doubt the coolest book I\\'ve ever written.I\\'m pretty sure you\\'ve never read a book like it.So . . . enjoy!WOW.

Abuzul la care l-a supus propria lui mamă la vremea când era doar un copil lipsit de apărare a lăsat urme adânci care încă îi mai dau coșmaruri.Și-a găsit liniștea atunci când Ray și Stella Quinn l-au primit în familia lor. Pacea a aflat-o în plimbările prin apele golfului.Grace este o tânără mamă care muncește pe rupte pentru a-i oferi fetiței ei tot ce are nevoie: lucrează ca ospătar într-un bar, face curățenie în casele oamenilor, totul pentru a-și putea cumpăra o casă și a-și crește copilul cum știe ea mai bine.Între cei doi există o chimie puternică, atracția sfârâie în aer de câte ori cei doi se află unul în preajma celuilalt. Ca să nu mai spunem că au sentimente unul față de altul de când se știu, dar Ethan a rezistat fără a-i da de înțeles ce simte pentru ea deoarece se simte nedemn de ea din cauza copilăriei sale. Grace pe de altă parte, a tot așteptat ca acesta să facă primul pas.O carte care se joacă cu emoțiile tale, te face să trăiești acțiunea la intensitate maximă, să savurezi micile momente de bucurie, să speri că problemele vor putea fi rezolvate.Autoarea Nora Roberts a creat două personaje deosebite, puternice și curajoase în ciuda loviturilor pe care viața le-a pus în calea lor.Am observat frământările celor doi, luptele lor cu ei înșiși, curajul cu care au decis să ia soarta în propriile lor mâini.O carte care ne vorbește despre unitatea și însemnătatea familiei, despre iubirea necondiționată, despre încredere.

Me apena un poco, pero con la buena puntuación que tiene ésta serie, esperaba que me gustara más.\"Cuando sube la marea\" es el segundo libro de la serie Bahía de Chesapeake, y en él tenemos la historia de Ethan Quinn, el pescador rudo y solitario de los hermanos Quinn y Grace Monroe, la chica de la que siempre estuvo secretamente enamorado.Grace era mucho más joven que Ethan, y él, tímido y con un terrible pasado, nunca se vio capaz de decirle nada. A Grace siempre le gustó Ethan, pero al ver que nunca se lanzaría, cometió un error de juventud: salió con el hombre equivocado, se casó con él, se quedó embaraza y su marido la dejó porque no se querían.Ahora Grace es una madre soltera que se parte el lomo por sacar adelante a su hija y criarla de la manera más digna posible.Cuando el libro empieza, el pequeño de los Quinn, Seth, se ha acostumbrado a su nueva vida. De todos los Quinn, Ethan es el que más se le parece y al que más entiende, quizás porque ambos pasaron por situaciones similares.Mientras los Quinn siguen criando a Seth, e intentando conseguir su custodia, están construyendo un pequeño y próspero astillero. Pero por el pueblo siguen los problemas y rumores sobre la muerte de Ray y su lazo con el propio Seth. Además, la madre de Seth seguirá dando guerra en éste libro.Todo esto va ocurriendo, cuando Ethan y Grace comienzan su historia, y no será fácil, pues hay muchos problemas entre ellos al principio. Ethan ve a Grace frágil y no le gusta que trabaje tanto y menos de camarera por la noche para que pueda ocurrirle algo. Grace tiene su orgullo y le echa muchas cosas en cara. Pero poco a poco, ésas discusiones darán paso a algo más, y es que en el fondo se importan.Ya se gustaban, pero capítulo a capítulo se van enamorando, y mientras todo es perfecto para Grace y crece de forma natural, para Ethan es difícil. Ethan siempre pensará que está manchado o tiene un carácter malvado como lo tuvo su madre, por eso mismo se prometió no casarse nunca ni enjendrar hijos a los que pudiera pasar su mala sangre.Sinceramente, creo que ya he leído muchos, muchísimos libros con ésta excusa para meter fricciones en el romance, y ya no me convencen. El libro en sí no está mal, pero se me hacía algo soso, así como la historia de amor.Puede que esperase más de lo que el libro podría ofrecerme, pero también lo pensé del primero y no me gustó. Aún así, tengo los siguientes libros esperando en la estantería, así que no tardaré en leerlos. No es una gran serie, pero no deja de ser de Nora Roberts.TW: SEXUAL ABUSE, SCENES OF SEXUAL ASSAULTUpon the death of their adopted father, Cameron, Ethan, and Philip Quinn have to band together to take care of Ray Quinn\\'s ten-year-old ward, Seth. Each book in theChesapeake Bay Sagaseries focuses on each brother tackling their demons and finding romance. But Seth\\'s biological mother, Gloria is always there ready to ruffle the feathers of the Quinn family.Rising Tidesis Ethan\\'s story and I must admit that I was looking forward to learning more about the introverted Quinn brother. More comfortable on a boat than on the shore, Ethan has for a long time loved from afar Grace Monroe, a single mother who cleans the Quinn homestead. Grace also finds herself attracted to Ethan. But waiting for Ethan to make the first move might just need a firm push.I am not going to pretend that after reading this installment in the series, I do have some feelings of unease. Nora Roberts doesn\\'t shy away from tough subjects and her main protagonist, Ethan experienced a lot in his childhood before Stella and Ray Quinn took him in. The scene in the book where Ethan reveals his back story to Grace is absolutely heartbreaking. That pain does in some ways eclipse the romance and even though I knew there would be a happy ending, I wasn\\'t sure that I wanted this story so rushed. For that reason, I gave the story three stars.Goodreads review published 06/05/23Rising Tidesis the second book in Nora Roberts\\' Chesapeake Bay / Quinn Brothers saga. It features the middle brother, Ethan, who was the 2nd boy rescued by Ray and Stella Quinn and given a new life. He\\'s the epitome of the saying \"still waters run deep.\" Ethan may be able to hold his own in a fight with his brothers, but he prefers to take things slow, to think them through and doesn\\'t see the need to chatter unless there\\'s something that really needs to be said. He\\'s battered and scarred from a tragic childhood that haunts him to this day. The abuse he suffered has kept him from acting on his feelings for young single mother Grace Monroe, but with Seth in the picture, Ethan finds that not only has his life drastically changed, but he can\\'t keep his feelings for Grace a secret any longer.This is yet another highly enjoyable book from Nora Roberts. I liked it almost as much as book 1 in the series. Ethan is such an interesting character. At times he\\'s just as rough and tumble as Cam but at other times, he\\'s a quiet loner. His tragic childhood is heartbreaking and it makes you just want to give him a big hug (and maybe a kiss or two...). When it comes to his relationship with Grace, you can really see how the past still haunts him and causes endless conflict. Roberts played that out perfectly, especially the resolution.Normally I don\\'t enjoy books with kids in them, but Grace\\'s daughter Aubrey is just too cute for words. I really liked her small parts in the book. And I liked Grace as well. She was a real sweetheart.One of the great things about this book, and common to NR trilogy books, is that even though the book focuses on one couple (in this case Ethan and Grace) you still get plenty of the other characters. They are still a basis of the story. It really helps you to know them better and develops this amazing sense of family and togetherness.And another great thing about the book is the progression of Seth\\'s story. It was touching to read about how much he\\'s improved since the Quinn\\'s took him in. He\\'s growing and starting to put the past behind him. I love the interactions he has with everyone. For a 10-year-old, he\\'s a really strongly developed character.If you read and enjoyedSea Sweptthen you should definitely read this book, and you\\'ll most likely enjoy it. It is a great continuation of the series and just an all-round nice romance to read.'}, {'title': 'Psy-Changeling #2Visions of Heat', 'author': 'Nalini Singh', 'summary': \"Hailed as a major new talent in paranormal romance, Nalini Singh takes us deeper into the world of the Psy and the changelings in her latest extraordinary novel, where a gifted woman sees passion in her future—a passion that is absolutely forbidden by her kind . . .\\nUsed to cold silence, Faith NightStar is suddenly being tormented by dark visions of blood and murder.

Such tender moments that brought tears to my eyes.The Psy-Changeling series is fast becoming my favorite paranormal/Sci-fi read. On to the next book...Faith Nightstar (Psy) and Vaughn D\\'Angelo\\xa0(Changeling)Faith is the best F-Psy i.e. of the foreseers. She has been working since she was three years old and she could talk. She almost never leaves her home, she has security 24 hours per day, her meals are planned and if she has to make contact with the Psy who is responsible for her in certain intervals of time. Otherwise everyone is worried. Sometimes she is so lost in her visions of the future that she forgets to eat or drink.Faith had never left the compound on her own. They\\'d put her inside twenty-one years ago, telling her that her mind couldn\\'t survive in the outside world, that the visions would come too thick and fast if she lived closely with others. She\\'d had no reason to disbelieve them and over the years, her home had become her chosen prison, a place she rarely left.Faith lives in a bubble. But lately she feels that she is going insane. Lately she does not think of the forecasting of business trends. On the contrary, she keeps dreaming of blood, murders and horrific acts.For that reason, she has decided that she needs help from an outsider and more particularly from Sascha, the Psy who left the Net and mated the Alpha of the DarkRiver pack.Vaughn is the jaguar and the sentinel of the DarkRiver pack. His Alpha, Lucas, totally trusts him -although Vaughn is more animal than man. When he was a kid, he had to stay in his animal form for a long time in order to survive and for that reason he feels more comfortable being a jaguar.\"Are you sure I\\'m that logical?”\"No. But you\\'re not an animal either.”He leaned in close until he had her boxed against the wall, his arms on either side of her body. One simple lift and he could have her at his sexual mercy. \\'That\\'s where you\\'re wrong, baby.\" He brushed his lips over her ear. \"I\\'m as animal as they come.\" Before she could say anything, he pushed off and walked into the kitchen.He heard the ragged gasp of her breath a few seconds later. \"Are you really?”He looked over his shoulder. \"What do you think?”When hot-blooded Vaughn meets emotionless Faith, he realises that Faith is important to him and that Faith cannot be that cold and distant. He needs to connect with her, but her isolated life only allows him to make baby steps to win her heart.\"Red hair.\" He\\'d never seen hair that deeply red, that luxuriously silky. The cat had wanted to play with it while the man had wanted to do much, much more intimate things.Moreover, Faith needs to prove her trustworthiness to the pack and Vaughn needs to help her identify the person that haunts her dreams and her psychological stability.At the same time the Psy Council needs a replacement for the murderer and sadist Santano Enrique who was eliminated and apparently Faith is a suitable candidate.Will she choose Vaughn and an unknown future or her career and a stable future?I am totally hooked on this series!I’m going to keep this short because thanks to this book I haven’t moved in about nine hours, my hair is greasy, I’m frigging starving and I’m also uncomfortably aroused.

That said... it was not what I expected. In good ways and in bad ways. Let\\'s start with something I\\'m not sure if I liked or not, but it sure had me intrigued: The Ocean.I really liked Her sometimes, but there were other times that She just confused me. I mean, I liked the idea, I think that She was the strongest character of the book, and it\\'s the first time I read something like it. Her relationship with the girls was one of my favorite aspects of the story, it was very motherly.Akinli was another character I really enjoyed reading, he was just too sweet, caring and funny. I just wish we had more of him in the book. Also! I liked that I thought I knew how his story would end and NOPE! Kiera really surprised me this time :P. I\\'m not saying I loved the way it ended, but it took me by surprise! Definitely not the cliché I was expecting.Now let\\'s talk about Kahlen... I kinda like her, but not so much. I\\'m in a point of my life were I can\\'t stand characters whose only aspiration in life is to get married. I also feel that she was unfair with her sisters most of the time... and half of the book she was just bitter and depressed. Blah...Hmmm what else? Oh! THE INSTA LOVE. I mean, it wasn\\'t exactly insta love, but it happened way too fast! I can accept that she instantly had a crush in Akinli (I mean, I would\\'ve, too!)... but then in one day she was suddenly in love. What. THEY WERE CUTE TOGETHER! But I\\'m not a fan of the whole \"soulmates\" thing when is not well developed :/...That\\'s everything I got to say (for now). I enjoyed the book, the ending felt satisfying, but that\\'s all.The Siren was a...SNOOZEFEST.I\\'m so disappointed in this book. I was such a huge fan of The Selection series so I expected to really like The Siren but honestly, everything was just superdull.The characters were boring. The only thing I enjoyed about the siren sisters was their dedication and loyalty to one another. The concept behind the Sirens and the Ocean was interesting but I didn\\'t really love it. And on top of that, the romance was100 percent insta-love.Their feelings developed too fast after just one date that lasted for about an hour and because of that, it became way too unrealistic for me and I couldn\\'t even feel any of theemotionsthat I was supposed to feel in the end.Prior to reading the book, I thought the negative reviews were just a little harsh and I expected that the book would actually improve by a long shot once Kiera Cassrewrote and republishedit again, but if I thought this\"new and improved\"version was ehhh, I could only imagine how the first edition must\\'ve been.The only thing that really saved this book for me was the last 50 pages or so but even then, 50 pages doesn\\'t nearly make up for the other disappointing 250.Long story short, reading The Siren felt like a Disney Little Mermaidknockoff.The only difference was that Disney actually pulled off the insta-love romance.Although this book fell short for me, I\\'m still ahuge fanof Kiera Cass. I love her writing and the concepts that she comes up with. Hopefully she comes out with a new book outside of The Selection series to make up for this one because you can always count on me to pick up a book by Kiera Cass.Please do yourself 2 favors:1. Do not avoid this book simply because you hated Cass\\'s The Selection series. The two are nothing, nothing, nothing alike. The characters, the world, the writing tone are all so very different. Sure, you may still dislike this one for any number of reasons, but if you\\'re interested in the premise, don\\'t judge it based on a totally separate book series.2. Do not avoid this book simply because mushy romances aren\\'t your thing. Yes, there is a romance, and that\\'s very much a big part of the story but there is also SO MUCH MORE. And it\\'s actually more of a tragic tale that I expected.This is a story about many types of love. Sisterly love. Friendship. Parental love. Learning to love yourself. (Love for cake.) And yes, romantic love too. This is one of the best romances I\\'ve read in a long time, which is ironic because the love interest appears in less than a quarter of the book total, but what I really took away from this book was all the other kinds of love. Especially the parental love. The parent in this book is the Ocean. She is very much a character in this story and the way in which she loves her Siren daughters is so reminiscent of a mother trying to hold on to her growing children.I\\'m struggling with wording this next part (thanks brain), but I also want to point out that although this book in no way felt like it was dealing with religion, I got a sense of some religious symbolism. I believe Cass is Christian, so I wondered if maybe the Ocean was meant to be a personification (naturification?) of God. There are definitely many traits of the Ocean that aren\\'t Biblical, but it was a parallel that I saw and it hit me on an emotional level. Any symbolism you may or may not personally see reflected in the Ocean aside, the way in which Cass brought to a life a character that in this world was a type of deity and creator full of undying and jealous love was simply astounding.There are a few more things I want readers to know about this story that make it really awesome.-The main characters are college age, which is refreshing.-The fantasy element of this world was VERY fleshed out. Siren mythology is not a backdrop, it\\'s heavily involved in the story.-The love interest was a good guy. A very believable, kind guy. A nice break from the over abundance of bad boys in YA and NA.And to be fair, here are some things that might turn you off.-There is a heavy dose of instalove. I can hear most of you groaning. But this was the most convincing case of instalove I have ever seen and the reason for that comes down to the fact that these characters didn\\'t spend every waking moment together with their feelings being clouded by being so wrapped up in each other. For the story being told here, it felt fitting.- I don\\'t even have another point here. But having only one point looked weird. Hi.Overall, it\\'s a simple and yet very powerful story that I think would appeal to readers young and old alike.This isn\\'t one of those books you can be super critical of. It\\'s very insta-lovey with less of a focused plot - a really tropey, white-and-heterosexual read with more of a fantasy element to the romance. But if you don\\'t really care too much you can enjoy it.Four stars, originally five. I’ve just read this so many times before reviewing it that I’ve picked up on all the unwelcome details…so my rating is lowered now.Let’s start with theplot. I looooove Greek mythology. I’m not saying that as a Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus/Rick Riordan fan. I’m saying that as someone who:- read several Greek mythology textbooks before ever picking up the Percy Jackson books- read the Iliadjust becausethe Odyssey was going to be an English assignment- read two different versions of the Odyssey just to get a “better understanding”.- has read all of the Percy Jackson books three times- has read the Heroes of Olympus series three times- has been to the Parthenon in Nashville- has randomly researched the minor gods/goddesses/creatures in Greek mythology out of boredomSo. I was expecting more Greek elements when I first picked this one up. Was I disappointed by the lack of mythology? Not really, since I had been anticipating this read for a while. I was too excited to finally read it to really care.[Okay, moving past my unnecessary list of stuff].I was a bit hesitant the first time I read this (which was about two years ago, maybe three. So I’m mainly writing from the perspective of my latest reread), because romance books are not really my thing. I had never read The Selection.But Ilovedthis.I really, really loved this. I loved all the characters (except for Elizabeth because she was more selfish and annoying), especially Miaka. I loved Kahlen’s perspective on everything and I loved how she still hadn’t figured herself out after ninety-nine years of life. I loved the concept of this private society of Sirens, and the system they served with the Ocean.I wasn’t quite there for theromance, which is a bit unfortunate since this is a romance book. Fight me, but insta-love is just so useless and annoying.I will win that fight.Still, Kahlen and Akinli were just so, socute. I couldn’t help rooting for them to be together (which is the point of a romance, but it doesn’t always work for me). They had chemistry, and they understood each other perfectly. It was so much fun to read.“Whatever happened, I\\'d met my person, the one my soul connected to.”Thewriting. I think the writing in this one was pretty different from The Selection – this was more flowery, more relaxed and swoon-worthy. I mean, it sounded similar, but this one felt sweeter (although, Kahlen is a lot sweeter than America).“Love is a risk worth taking.I\\'d waited an eternity for this.I\\'d have waited all over again if I had to.I was meant to be kiss this boy, designed to be held by him.All the careful postures I held melted away, and I pulled him closer.We were stars.We were music.We were time.”Thecharacterswere all fun, but they weren’t layered or deep. Which was fine, I think, since that wasn’t a huge part of the story. It felt like the only two main characters were really Kahlen and Akinli, and the Ocean of course. But everyone else was just a side character.That being said, I loved Miaka. I empathized with Padma. And I admired Elizabeth, as much as she annoyed me. I do love my badass heroines (AELINNNNN) but Kahlen was really amazing. She is essentially a normal girl – and over the course of the novel, she realizes that time and time again. She isn’t strong or unbreakable, she’s human. And I loved having an element like that in this kind of book.“How magical it was just to be a normal girl.”I liked the idea of thesystemthat the Sirens served, with the Ocean. It was really easy to understand, but it was a real central force in the book. I think I’d love to be a siren for the experience it gets. But the way it was painted in the plot was just unflattering, mostly because it goes against everything the main character truly wanted.“I kept waiting for something to happen, which isn’t how life works. In closed environments, everything just repeats.”Holy shit does that quote up there represent quarantine.I thinkmy favorite partwas the one day that Kahlen and Akinli had together. It was magical, and reading it reminded me of how I felt in seventh grade. There was a boy, and he liked me, and we were pretty good friends (if anyone actually wants to know, we weren’t a thing). And our moments together felt kind of the way I did when reading that day in Port Clyde – like someone actually knew me and cared.It didn’t last. But it was nice to find that kind of feeling.“I could tell in his face that I could burn the house down, and he’d just get out marshmallows and thank me for the lovely flame. I’m not sure I could make a mistake big enough for him not to forgive.”Overall, I loved this book. I loved it the first time I read it, and I still love it now. My only issue is that I enjoyed it less this time around, because I could find all the little things that were covered up before. It\\'s not really a super-critical book, since it doesn\\'t really cover a lot, but overall it\\'s a light read. I see why people don\\'t like it, as it\\'s definitely not the best, but I enjoy this one.'}, {'title': 'These Hollow Vows #1These Hollow Vows', 'author': 'Lexi Ryan', 'summary': \"From New York Times best-selling author Lexi Ryan, Cruel Prince meets A Court of Thorns and Roses in this sexy, action-packed fantasy about a girl who is caught between two treacherous faerie courts and their dangerously seductive princes.Brie hates the Fae and refuses to have anything to do with them, even if that means starving on the street.

And with her heart.\", 'rating': '3.97', 'reviews': 'My hatred for the main character and other love interest overpowers my enjoyment of the story😶Literally from page 50, I\\'ve predicted the outcome of this love triangle and I swear to god if it actually ends like that- 🙂🔪🔪Once upon a time, a golden faerie princess fell in love with the shadow king, but their kingdoms had battled for hundreds of years and her parents were sworn enemies of the king and his kingdom . . .In this world, the Fae are viewed as many things. For some, they are loved and worshipped. For others, they are feared and subjected to their slavery. And then there are those humans who carry a deep hatred towards their kind--Abriella (or Brie) is one of these people.After failing to pay back a long-overdue debt, Abriella\\'s sister, Jas, is sold and taken to the King Mordeus aka the Unseelie King of the Fae Realm. Brie will do anything to get her sister back, making a bargain with the king himself to retrieve 3 ancient artifacts in exchange for her safeand alive.All she has to do is take place in a sort of \\'competition\\' between other girlsaltho is it even a competition??in which the Prince chooses who he wants as his queen. Brie must hold the Prince\\'s trust and capture his heart in order to gain access to these artifacts and give them the Unseelie King. Do that and she\\'ll get her sister back.But of course there are many complications and a rebel group lead by the Unseelie Prince and trying to guard her heart from the two ~seductive~ Princes, etc, etc.The main character, Abriella, is nOt LiKe OtHeR gIrLs because she doesn\\'t want to marry the Seelie Fae Prince for some ridiculous notion like love and she\\'s ~speshul~ because she has powers that nobody else in the world has. Fae would straight up say to her\"You\\'re special\"and continue repeating it ahahaha *cursed laugh*Sebastian is a cinnamon roll (but i dont love him) and deserves better than Abriella. And just because he\\'s a cinnamon roll,I can bet on my lifethat Abriella is going to end up with the dArK aNd BrOoDiNg princei say this like i dont fall for them too half the timeI usually like dark and brooding love interests but only if they\\'re secretly soft/a cinnamon roll and respect the MC, but in this case... haha no. Finn is an arrogant, disgusting pig that treats the main character in a condescending way and is such a rude jerk, yet the main character says that she feels like she has a cOnNeCtIoN with him-I hate Brie bc of how annoying she is, so maybe those twoareperfect for each other. Sebastian deserves someone better🥺but he\\'s also really sus sooo...Finn can go die in a hole. Abriella can go with Finn if she loves him so much.Sebastian isn\\'t really all that great either but he\\'s a thousand times better than Finn. It\\'s always the cinnamon rolls that are never chosen in a love triangle but maybe the author will prove me wrong😔doubtfulThis dude here at least is sweet, kind, considerate, soft, and must deal with the MC\\'s stupid decisions and dramatics smh. idk how Sebastian does it.but he\\'s also a deceiving piece of trash so maybe he does deserve to deal with all of this ¯\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ // basically i hate all these characters.I can see how this is compared toThe Cruel Princebut really the only similarity is that just like how Jude was involved in some spying within the court, Abriella is too, but that\\'s about it. Cardan Greenbriarcannotbe compared to either of the love interests. He\\'s leagues away from these fools who call themselves Fae.Now for where it\\'s likeA Court of Thorns and Roses... I dont see it??? idk maybe my brain\\'s just not working right now but I don\\'t see anything ACOTAR related unless the main character going to the Fae world was supposed to be the similarity...? Or maybe how like Feyre had to go through 3 trials, the MC has to retrieve 3 artifacts??? hmmm idk. I did get some Tamlin vibes from Sebastian which is when I\\'d despise him, but I can\\'t really think of anything else.Seriously though, the Fae here are a joke. They don\\'t even feel like Fae honestly like??? They speak and act just like humans and je n\\'aime pas. They\\'re so lame and there was a certain battle scene at the end that has to beone of the most ridiculous outcomes of a battle I\\'ve ever read in my life.😭🤚 I guess I expected more from the supposed villain ahaha and this is Fae we\\'re talking about-They\\'re more like humans trying so hard to act like Fae but failing miserably. Maybe if this is your first Fae book then you won\\'t mind them, but I\\'ve read too many about them to believe that the ones here were actually written well.Also I realized that always in Fae related books there has to be a some sort of scene where the MC drinks some faerie wine/fruit and becomes intoxicated/delirious and soon after that is there some sort of intimate scene😶 the one here was *chokes* awful.Oh and the amount of scenes that made me cringe ahahaha💀 but the world isn\\'t bad, it\\'s pretty interesting at the very least. That ending though has to be one of the most abrupt ones I\\'ve ever read like wow. Also, I did not expect that plot twist at all. How can I both hate and enjoy a book? trashy fun.Overall, this wasn\\'t completely bad, I guess. The story itself kept me engaged and I was able to finish this really fast in about a day, but even that wasn\\'t enough for me to like the book bc of its other faultsmainly the characters. I think that if you don\\'t mind the characters then you\\'ll most likely enjoy the book. I probably would\\'ve given this a higher rating if Finn didn\\'t exist.But yes, I\\'m going to read the next book only to see who she ends up with.(2.5⭐)Thank you HMH Books for sending me an ARC via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review!─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───Pre-read Review:\"Cruel Prince meets A Court of Thorns and Roses . . .\"Say no more—Me want.ALSO, WHY IS THAT COVER SO BEAUTIFUL?!?!i hate that i picked this up knowing full well that there would be a love triangle. and i hate that i didnt hate it.but the love triangle isnt why im rating this so high (even though both guys could get it). its the betrayals.honestly, with what is given in this first installment, i would consider the three MCs to be good people and they dont really fit the villain role. but they are also totally out for themselves and i love that. yes, they care about each other, but they care about their cause, their kingdom, or their sister so much more. and when it got to the end, i was downright delighted to see such backstabbing, even if the characters had (seemingly) good intentions behind it all. the next book is going to have so much revenge and i cant wait.this was a very unexpected surprise and a fantastic mood read. it definitely gave me‘the selection,’‘the cruel prince,’and‘from blood and ash’vibes at times. so fantasy and fae lovers should love this one!↠4.5 starsi’m in pain. words can’t even describe how much i hate this book. but numbers can: 482616/10this… thing should be illegal. because this is, dear friends, plagiarism. you know, when they said it’s similar to acotar, they probably forgot to mention that it is actually a carbon copy of acotar. there is no single original thing. not. a. single. one.welcome to diana’s guide how to recognize shitty books:1. insufferable main heroine who is speshul and nOt LikE othEr giRLswe have here a standard main heroine brie, who is speshul maximally by being duller and stupider than all the other girls altogether. she makes one illogical decision after another, she is annoying, hypocritical, but for some incomprehensible reason everyone loves her.brie has hated fairies all her life, but as soon as she sees one, she immediately thinks:“this is no simple faerie. he’s stunning.”and be careful, put a lot of emphasis on the word “STUNNING”!2. the most powerful dark haired love interest without personality with tantrums and a tragic past, which is his excuse for acting like an idiot all the timehe is tattooed, disgusting and charming like a napkin, but the main heroine falls in love with him anyway. (though it’s an insult to a napkin that has more characteristics)by the way, he looks like rhysand, because… well, because it’s so described, he just has silver eyes instead of violet.but if it were:“the human girl fell in love with the stunning seductive fairy prince within 5 minutes and then they lived happily ever after”,everyone would probably die of boredom. therefore, the author added a second love interest, which is also a stunning seductive fairy prince, but he has a different hair color, so that a love triangle can be formed.3. nice and kind second love interest, who hasn’t the slightest chance and who is in the book only to be dumped by the main heroinehe is tattooed and boring too, but still better than the first love interest whose name i forgot, because he’s so annoying that he doesn’t deserve to be remembered.funny fact is that this character has also white hair and green eyes, which reminds me of another fae prince – do you know rowan whitethorn?brace yourself for something shocking. this character’s name is ronan. so we have roWan and roNan. the author seriously changed only one letter. *broken laugh*even the names are non original. but she probably wanted to save this disaster by giving him one another name – sebastian. (a nice name is the best thing about him)anyway, his image is the same as rowan’s, but his behaviour resembles more of cardan greenbriar in not-cardan day. except for the fact that cardan is better (and i’m saying this as a person who hated him for 2 books).and because of this combination:rowan whitethorn + cardan greenbriar,we should call the second love interest #whitebriar or #greenthorn. you can choose.4. copy a popular series that everyone knows and then argue that the book is originallet’s look at the similarities with acotar. or rather at the absolute same things with different titles:7 courts – 7 courts7 high lords – 7 magicians3 tasks – 3 artifactsmate bond – bondrhysand – the main love interest whose name i forgottamlin – ronan / sebastian / whitebriarthere was even a scene with fairy wine and dancing. it has the same ending as acotar. the concept is same. the story is same. everything is same.i could go on indefinitely, but the point is that if you have read acotar before, you already know everything what happened here.5. add another popular series so that no one knows that the whole story is a mix of famous booksi don’t see similarities with the cruel prince (which is surprising), but instead of that there is the selection vibes. fairy seductive prince has to choose between several girls. they are all dull and interesting as a piece of bread, but we all know whom he chooses. the dullest and the least interesting one.if i should compare these 2 series:maxon – whitebriar (ronan)aspen – the other onethe selection – the selectiona king of illea’s personality is same as personality of a king of the unseelie courtby the way, nor is the unseelie court created by this author. this place already existed in the series “forgotten realms”.6. bad writing style with italics on every page and repeating each sentence because killing my brain cells seems like a good ideai don’t want to go into detail as i usually do, so i’ll cut it short into this: endless internal dialogues about the same thing, the mc talking to herself, repeating the same sentence over and over again. i’m tired and sick of it.this is not “it’s me, not the book” situation. because it is this BOOK’S fault. and i don’t get how it can have an average 4,07. for what, plagiarism?so here is the conclusion. it’s terrible. absolutely, totally terrible and in addition, it caused me brain damage. rest in peace, my brain cells.3.5 stars ✨Despite being a love triangle, so many people adore this book and I just had to find out why and after finishing this book, I finally understand.I love the characters and how it is so easy to immerse yourself in the story. Brie, Sebastian and Finn are such well thought out characters. Although they are not something you haven\\'t read before? They still stand out. There\\'s something about these three characters that just draws one in.The story is quite captivatingas well and I absolutely loved theimmersive feelof it.The world building is weak imo or at least the execution of it is weak.There were places where things did not make much sense to me, or left me feeling confused and lost. It was like I was given 20% backstory with some world building in chapter 10, then 5% in chapter 23 and then in chapter 30, the backstory from chapter 10 gets picked up again. I found it to be quite confusing.Another reason why it\\'s not a perfect read isit reminded me a lot of ACOTAR.Sure, I can call it inspiration, which it probably is but it was A LOT. The characters, the fae world, the romances, training, Calanmai lol, etc etc. It made things seem predictable.Despite the characters seeming similar to ACOTAR, I loved them a lot.Brieis fierce, caring, got trust issues, has a badass yet innocent vibe to her, and is a loyal person.Sebastianis complex. I liked him and how much of a layered character he is. He\\'s an idiot tho.Finnis MINE. LOVE HIM 🤌 Man\\'s morally grey and had his own agendas sure and I don\\'t care how bad that man can get, I love him 😩😩Theromancewas sweet, angsty and pretty much one sided for me. I knew which guy I would like from the moment he was introduced and I was there for it. Love triangles hardly bother me tbh 😅Theendingtho, I had so many emotions. I was like YESSS, then NOOO, then YESSS and now BROOOO 😩😭 I need revenge. Bad.Thanks to beautiful Emily for reading this with me. I loved how much we adored Finn and had the best time with you 🤎~•~•~LET\\'S GOOOOLet me start this review by saying that yes, I am a garbage human being and love triangle whore. I love them more than enemies to lovers, the \"stuck in a room with only bed,\" bit and also forced marriages. I will hold up a sign stating as such on a white posterboard next to the guy with the poster saying, \"STOP SAYING PIN NUMBER. IT\\'S REDUNDANT.\"When I first heard about this book, I raced to my emails, gathered my stats, and promptly sent a message to the publisher. My grabby hands were shaking, trembling with anticpation. I could not wait for my NetGalley request to go through. I needed the book NOW otherwise I\\'d proably die. Lucky for me, I got a reply almost right away with the READ NOW widget and I nearly collapsed. It\\'s a good thing my office has carpeting.So, we have a both with comp titles such as CRUEL PRINCE and ACOTAR and be still my YA heart, those are comp titles you want to sell a book. I will buy anything when I read those two titles in a synopsis. That being said, after I recovered from getting my immediate READ NOW widget, I dropped (literally dropped) my current read (Crave, I will come back to you before the month ends!), gathered my hot cheetos and dove right in.We open the story with Brie, who is a thief trying to keep her small family afloat. When her debts become too large, her little sis is sold to the fae. Pushing aside her hatred of the fae, Brie gets herself in the faerie court where she discovers: a secret about a long-time friend (and herself), that she suddenly has magic, and that the fae are manupulative creatures, as well as a little bit hot and charming.Did I say hot and charming? *fans self*Yea, so Brie finds herself torn between two princes, each with their own agendas. Who can she trust?You know a story is good when it overrides your prescription sleeping medication. I was up far too late reading this book. But its one of my preferred ways of falling asleep; right in the arms of my fae lovers.What we have here is a glowing newcomer into the YA world, rivaling Maas and Black themselves. I seriously cannot get over how fantastic this book was. I mean, I kinda knew, but I still wasn\\'t prepared. I want more!Ok enough ramblings.THE WORLD-BUILDING: Amazing. I loved the courts and the human world. I got a clear sense of how drastically different they were. The world of the fae is wicked and scary, and Ryan\\'s writing made them leap off the page. The complex, political intrigue and the magic surrounding almost everything was beautiful and deadly.There\\'s a 100% chance I\\'m going to buy every special edition of this book. JSTHE STORY:There are plenty of twists and turns that keep you guessing.There\\'s also princes with pretty eyes and tattoos.I love princes with pretty eyes and tattoos.FAMILY TIES:I loved the emphasis on family. Brie will do anything to get her sister back and I mean ANYTHING. And although her focus may wane at times, she always goes back to her and what she needs to do to get her family back together, safe and sound.THE ROMANCE:I feel lots of warm things for Finn.I mean, come on. He\\'s broody, and frowns a lot and I love that in a man. I care so much about him. I didn\\'t want to because my book boyfriend cart is full. I may just have to throw out Kaz. He wasn\\'t the real interest, if you catch my drift, but I have a feeling he\\'s going to come in strong in book two. That one scene though where she was...and he was...and he had to....OMGTHE PROTAG:Brie is determined, fearful but courageous. She\\'s everything I love in a heroine. She may be a human in a fae court, but she holds her own.Ok, let\\'s talk about the ending. HOLY COW COW.I\\'ve read this book way too early and now I\\'m going to have to wait for book two even longer. It\\'s not fair. Life isn\\'t fair.Final thoughts:READ THIS BOOKIf you like fae books and need a change from the usual, this is the one for you. If you like sexy princes, and dark magic and scheming heroines, this is also for you.BOOKSTAGRAM'}, {'title': 'Sookie Stackhouse #6Definitely Dead', 'author': 'Charlaine Harris', 'summary': \"Since Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse has so few living relatives, she hates to lose one - even her cousin Hadley, undead consort of the vampire Queen of Louisiana.

I have zero sympathy for the main character in this book.This is the sorriest fucking excuse of a revenge novel that I have ever read.The whole thing is a fucking mating dance.There is a way of exacting retribution, and it is nowhere to be found in this book. You could search over this book with a fine-tooth comb. You could examine every inch with the most powerful of electron microscope, but the point is that there\\'s nary a iota of revenge-exacting in this novel. It is a cookie cutter romance novel with the slightest hint of wrongdoing and a promise of revenge and nothing more than that.The Summary: Let\\'s keep the summary short so I can get on with my rant. 12 years ago, 16-year old heiress Mara disappeared. The bad news is that the future Duke of Lamont was accused of her murder.He was naked. In a bed that was not his own.And he was covered in blood.His memory of the night before is completely gone. He cannot remember a single thing. Without a body, he cannot be convicted, but his name and his family name has been dragged through the mud. He may be a Duke in title, but he and his family\\'s name is blacklisted. Society will never, ever accept him. He was sent into exile by his father. A promising young man with his life ahead of him, sent into the streets. He adopted the name Temple, he begins fighting as a boxer, and made his reputation as the Killer Duke. 12 years later, he has made his own fortune, but society will never forget that he is a killer. But then Mara appears, with a deal. She will clear her name.He just wants his revenge. Does Temple fucking go for the throat? Hang her out to dry for the years of torment he has caused her?Does Temple get his retribution? Only if retribution is a fucking synonym for \"falling in love.\"I hate, hate, HATE people who make false accusations. People who bear false witness on the stand who cause an innocent person to be imprisoned for decades. People who falsely accuse another of rape. People who falsely accuse another of defamation. The sight of the newly freed as they see their families again, the knowledge of the years of their lives lost due to a false accusation, all the pain and misery that they must have undergone in prison---it just breaks my heart.Fucking cow.I Destroyed Your Life: Now What?:A false accusation destroys lives. A false accusation destroys a person.Have you ever been falsely accused of something you have not done? It is not pleasant. I have. I have never, ever felt so much anger and helplessness and frustration as when I had been falsely accused of something I did not do.I have a very limited amount of sympathy for someone who willingly destroys someone\\'s life. Spare me your fucking excuses, you monster of a woman. Yeah, the heroine has a sad backstory, wah wah wah. Boo fucking hoo. Cry me a motherfucking river, because gues what? I don\\'t give a fucking crap. Play me your very tiniest of violins because I have had it up to here with your fucking bullshit, you miserable excuse for a woman.Mara is the type of woman who give womanhood a bad reputation.She shirks her duties. She makes wrongs and sticks her fucking head in the sand (for 12 years! 12 FUCKING YEARS!)From the beginning of this book, Mara has an uphill battle to fight for my approval. She never, ever once comes close to winning over my heart.I\\'m So Sorry I Ruined Your Life, Would You Like Some More?:The main character is set up to be a sympathetic anti-heroine. Mara is not sympathetic. I never, ever once felt anything for her but complete, utter loathing.She committed a wrong, and she ended up making a man pay for it not with his life, but his reputation, his dignity, without his heritage, a disgrace to his family name. She has taken everything from him. She is a fucking cunt. She is a self-righteous twat. She deserve to be ostracized from society. Were this medieval times, Mara deserves to be pilloried with rotten eggs and fruit thrown at her, and I would gladly chuck a putrid basket of rotten papaya, a few coconuts, and several bricks shaped as fruits at her self-professedly saintly fucking head.Fucking trollop.This is Mara\\'s fucking version of repaying all the bad, bad things she\\'s ever done.Mara: Waaaaaah. WAAAAAH! I am so sorry that I\\'ve ruined your life. I am so sorry that for the past 12 years, I\\'ve let you lived with a blank memory of the night in which you\\'ve killed me. I am so sorry about what happened that night that I won\\'t fucking tell you anything about what happened, leaving you in complete, utter anguish, leaving you to torment yourself with doubt until the very end.She should tell him.The whole story.The money, the debt, the reason she’d run. She should lay herself at his feet and give him the chance to forgive her. To believe her. To believe in her.Yes, the very fucking end, after which I will give you Ze Grand Reveal, which is as exciting a secret as the fact that I fart 15 times a day under my petticoats.I\\'m so sorry that I won\\'t even fucking TELL YOU TO YOUR FUCKING FACE that I\\'m sorry.“Do you regret your actions?”She met his eyes. “Do you wish the truth? Or a platitude?”I\\'m so fucking sorry, I really am. I\\'m so sorry that due to society\\' false conviction of you as a killer (which was my fault in the first place), you were ostracized and branded the Killer Duke. I\\'m so sorry that I will equate the fact that I lived for 12 years, fucking scot-free fully in knowledge that I\\'ve destroyed an innocent man, because I TOTALLY KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.“I understand that you are angry.”The words seemed to call to him, and he came toward her, glass still in hand, stalking her backward, across the too-small room. “You understand, do you?”Yes.“You understand what it is to have lost my name?”She did, rather. But she knew better than to say it.He pressed on. “To have lost my title, my land, my life?”Yes, I am so fucking sorry. I am so sorry that I will extort money out of you in order for me to do what\\'s right and prove to the world that you are innocent.“I shall tell the truth. Come forward with proof of my birth. And you shall forgive my brother’s debt. I think it’s a fair trade.”“A fair trade for destroying my life?”I am so fucking sorry for all the wrongs that I\\'ve done to you that I will threaten to escape once again, leaving you fully aware this time that I am alive, but knowing you cannot prove it unless I am here.“I disappeared once before. I can do it again.\"I am so very sorry for drugging you the night that I faked my death, leaving you covered in blood.He interrupted her thoughts. “You drugged me!”I am ever so fucking sorry that I drugged you, so sorry that I will express my remorse by---DRUGGING YOU AGAIN.“Goddammit!” he said, his glass falling from his hand as he lunged toward her, missing his mark, catching himself on the edge of the chair. “You did it...again...”I am so sorry that your name is ruined in society that I will rectify my error by completely battering your fucking name into the ground. I will publicly challenge you to a boxing duel in front of a full house! Surely that will do the trick.She was ringside and through the ropes in seconds, and the moment she stood there, in the uneven sawdust, the room began to quiet.She took a deep breath and spoke, letting her voice run loud and clear in the enormous room. “I, too, have a debt with The Fallen Angel, Duke. So tell me. Will you accept my challenge?”Because of course, fighting me will completely fucking clear your bloody name in society. Why? Because if you beat me, you will be known as a fucking woman-beater. And if you let me win, you will be known in society as a boxer who fucking lost to a woman.I will let you have your revenge by putting you in a situation in which you cannot fucking possibly win.I am so fucking sorry that I feel that my life has been destroyed by men, so that I will take it out on a man who has been completely innocent of doing anything to me.Temple had been collateral damage.I will acknowledge my wrongdoing internally while doing everything possible to defy the man whom I have wronged. I am so sorry that I was a completely fucking stupid cunt.“I never meant to hurt you.” She paused, her gaze flickering over his shoulder to the mirror where the women had watched the fight. “It never occurred to me that you would suffer.”He didn’t say anything. Didn’t have to. The idea that her actions would have no consequences for him was pure idiocy.I am so sorry that yet again, I will extort money out of you for making love to me.“I don’t care what your reasons are, or how well you’ve fabricated them. I am done. How much was this worth? This afternoon?”The words were a blow. He couldn’t believe she would ask to be paid for.I\\'m so fucking sorry that I destroyed your life and stabbed you in the back that I will allow my brother to literally stab you.The knife landed hard and deep in Temple’s chest, blood blooming from it like a perverse blossom.Some people are emotional vampires. They suck the happiness, the hope, the life out of everyone and everything they touch. Mara is one of them. She is a despicable excuse of a human being. She fills me with anger and hate. There was not a single moment in this book in which I felt a minute substance of sympathy for her.Mara does not deserve a happily ever after, and the fact that she gets one makes me sick to my stomach.Fucking tramp.Retribution is a Synonym for Love!: Oh, Temple. Dear, dear angry Temple. He is so filled with hate, so filled with righteous anger! I don\\'t blame him. I have the utmost sympathy for him---until he attempts to get revenge.The key word is attempt. Because his way of exacting revenge is the equivalent of tickling a little kitten under its chin very, very hard.Oh, but it\\'s a HARD tickle. Therefore it\\'s acceptable. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? WHERE IS THE RAGE? WHERE IS THE ANGER? Temple gets MAD. Only he doesn\\'t. He gets ANGRY. Until he sniffs Mara\\'s hair. He is FURIOUS! Until he sees how lovely Mara is. He is IRATE. Until he feels bad about Mara and the fact that she has really harsh, dry hands because she hasn\\'t been able to lead the life of a lady IN THE 12 YEARS THAT SHE LET PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT HE WAS A MURDERER.ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? SERIOUSLY, ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? HOW THE FUCK IS THIS ANY SORT OF REVENGE?Mara drugs him! OH NO PEOPLE THINK I\\'M A MURDERER. I LOST MY NAME, MY FORTUNE, MY REPUTATION. She\\'s back!Oh, how lovely and untouched by time she looks! It\\'s almost as if I didn\\'t fucking kill her!OH SHIT SHE DRUGGED ME AGAIN. Why, that clever, cunning girl!Oh, look, she wants to extort money out of me! But that\\'s alright, she\\'s got a fucking orphanage to feed.Her brother fucking stabbed me! She may have been in on it! But she\\'s so lovely!...her, with her pretty, soft hair and her strange, irresistible eyes and her strength beyond measure. Thoughts that did not make him question just why she had done what she’d done so many years ago.Strength beyond measure! Sure! She\\'s got so much backbone, so much strength that she never shows it in any way besides living the kind of hard life that 95% of non-wealthy women live for the rest of their drudge-filled life. Never mind that she\\'s not forced to be a whore, because really, it takes so much fucking strength to fucking run an orphanage. A fishmonger? A tailor? A maid? No such work for our fucking saint of a false speaker, Mara.STRONG? BULLSHIT. Temple puts fucking Mara on a pedestal when she does not deserve it.He completely forgets about retribution and starts waxing on and off about her beauty and strength every fucking moment. All thoughts of retribution and revenge goes out the fucking window. Seriously, fuck that shit. Oh, she tried to kill him? Noooooo, noooooo she wouldn\\'t. I mean, what evidence is there that Mara might want to hurt him? OH, WAIT, THE FACT THAT SHE LET PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT HE KILLED HER 12 YEARS AGO? And yet...Temple shook his head. She hadn’t tried to kill him. He couldn’t believe it. He wouldn’t.Oh fucking Temple, fucking Temple, you fucking birdbrain.Take your fucking brain out of its penis, remove your fucking balls and hand it to Mara already, you fucking doormat. You fucking sorry excuse of a man.I have adored and beyond loved everything I\\'ve read by Sarah MacLean, thus far. I usually wait on pins and needles for her books to be published and then devour them as quickly as I can. When I finish, I predictably find my enthusiasm well satisfied, followed by a bittersweet mix of the glow of an amazing story well told, and separation anxiety.This book, unfortunately, did not continue the trend: I absolutely, without a doubt, loathed the character of Mara. Her attitude and personality pissed me off in a big away, which was a feeling that only deepened and hardened as the novel went on. Simply put: this woman has no conscience, no empathy, and no ability to love anyone but herself.First things first: we learn Mara ruined Temple\\'s life twelve years prior to this story, by framing him for her murder. Obviously this is something that completely changed the course of his life for the worse, and tanks his reputation and his good name for years after; reputation is a big deal in the Regency period, whereupon a man’s word was as good as his bond, and his name being smeared impacts absolutely everything socially. Things of smaller consequence have ruined people of larger standing.Secondly, as the story plays out, we find that Mara comes back into Temple’s life with the gall to act like he owes HER something.She doesn’t come back because she’s so wracked with guilt that he’s a ruined man, at her hands, and she wants to set it right. She didn\\'t reveal herself to him as alive to apologize or try to repent for all the ill she\\'d caused him – no, she had other shit on her agenda, shit that had nothing to do with him...except using him as a method of fixing her current predicament.On several occasions, she even has the nerve to get upset with him because he just wasn\\'t playing her game, and wasn\\'t giving her what she wanted. She’s pissy and argumentative, angry that he’s getting in her way of achieving whatever it is her plans are now, and she makes it clear she’s only come back for her own continued, ludicrous selfishness.Now, yes – her ultimate goal is the orphanage for “her boys” and absolving her brother of his debt, and these might be noble causes….if she had any kind of morals or ethics. However, Mara continually shows no growth, no sympathy, no scruples and no principles. Just like the situation 12 years before, this stuff happens to be important TO HER, and thus it’s perfectly okay to screw over anyone she has to in the process.To add insult to injury, Mara had Temple by the short and curlies, and kept dangling information he was lacking about the night he was found in a pool of \"her\" blood (due to his being drugged and remembering very little after he passed out) in front of him, a game that proved profitable for her monetarily. He was repeatedly forced to fork over money for every one of those tidbits of explanation, so he could piece together what actually occurred.She ALSO kept making hints that she could offer him complete redemption and clear his good name -- but only if he played by her rules, kept out of her way, and helped her get what she wanted.Talk about kicking a man when he\\'s down. How utterly narcissistic and controlling can one person be? Apparently absolving a man for a crime he didn\\'t commit just isn\\'t worth it unless you can use it as a bribe to get your own ends met (again) as well.Every other page, I wanted to yell at the book: \"You dumb, conniving bitch! You deserve all that and more! You ruined HIS LIFE BEYOND REPAIR! You should be licking his BOOTS asking him to forgive you!\".Thus, gentle reader, Temple is a pawn for a disgusting, manipulative woman, and nothing more. She didn’t deserve him, not even a little bit, and frankly I’m a little appalled that he’d even fall in love with a woman of no honorable character. It\\'s all \"congratulations on your face, my penis is hard; let\\'s give it a go\" because there\\'s nothing else between them that isn\\'t toxic and ruinous and it\\'s all her fault.At the end of the novel, Mara’s (long awaited) remorse that things went further off course than she intended 12 years ago came way, way too late and without enough convincing for me. It felt false and had me going, \"oh, please\", without much sympathy. It was almost as though Temple was now what she wanted and so she was going to say whatever she had to to win him, just as she does everything else in her life.In truth, if she were smarter, she could have done a zillion other things and handled her situation totally differently than FRAMING A MAN FOR HER MURDER AND THEN COMING BACK TO MANIPULATE HIM TO FIX THE NEW SHIT IN HER LIFE. But she didn\\'t. She got blinded by her own needs (back then and through the current story) and was okay about screwing others over when her ass was on the line -- proving she\\'d grown and matured not one whit over the time lapse.So my end feeling: Mara is a complete, monstrous, unrepentant ASSHOLE.Just ugh.As ever, I\\'m a terrible judge. But I like Temple. And Mara. And Lavender (You\\'ll learn about Lavender when you read the book).xo4 redeeming stars.****Review completed December 2, 2013For the last twelve years Temple (William Harrow, Marquess of Chapin and heir to the dukedom of Lamont) had lived with the conviction that he killed Mara Lowe on the eve of her wedding with his father. After that fateful night Mara disappeared without trace. But then quite unexpectedly Mara appears at Temple\\'s townhouse, hale and hearty. A myriad of emotions hits him. As a matter of fact, he didn\\'t only feel relief when he knew that she was alive. If anything, Temple felt angry, betrayed and bitter. After all, she\\'d stolen a major part of his life when she set him up so long ago. Temple wants to know what happened that fateful night at Whitefawn. However, Mara is not willing to tell him anything if Temple won\\'t accept a trade. Even though Temple\\'s reputation had been destroyed twelve years ago, he was one of the wealthiest men in London. And Mara needs moneyfor the MacIntyre Home for Boys.Finally they make a deal and start playing a \"game\" until Temple decides to reveal Mara\\'s identity, so he can restore his good name in exchange forher brother\\'s debt. Mara\\'s brother gambled not only his fortune away but also Mara\\'s money and the funds of the children\\'s home.\"You are angry.\"He shook his head. \"Angry does not even begin to describe the depths of my emotion.\"She nodded, skipping backward across the room once more. \"Fair enough. Furious.\"He advanced. \"That\\'s closer.\"\"Irate.\"\"That, too.\"She looked behind her, saw the sideboard looming. This wasn\\'t a very large room, after all.\"Livid.\"\"And that. \"It\\'s time to take responsibility for past transgressions.So, while Temple is out for retribution, over time he began to actually like and adore Mara. Hewantedher. Though Temple hadn\\'t expected for that to happen.He was beside her in an instant, collecting her in his arms, pulling her tight to him, and taking her lips. Claiming her in front of God and London. Tasting her sweetness. Her spice. The roar of those assembled faded away as he consumed her, the kiss too rough, too searing, until he realized that she was matching it with her own passion. Her own fervor.Lavender was a pure joy, so hilarious! There were a couple adorable scenes that included the two dozen boys, Temple, Mara andthe piglet.In fact, Temple has a very good hand when it comes to kids and he passed on some pearls of wisdom now and then.Meet Lavender...She turned in her chair to look up at him. \"It was not meant as one. I was merely pointing out your libidinous ways.\"His brows rose. \"Libidinous.\"\"Roguish. Rakish. Scallawaginous. Scoundrelly.\"\"I\\'m certain that some of those words are not words.\"\"Now you\\'re angling for a position as governess?\"\"If the boys are learning words like scallawaginous, it might not be the worst idea.\"At 52 % something very tragic happened.There were no angels. There was no peace.At least, not for Temple.There was nothing that tempted him toward bright, comforting light, nothing that gave him solace as pain burned through him, threatening his thought and breath.(…)His angels did not come from above; they came from below, and they tempted him to join them. His angels were the fallen ones. And they did not speak in melodic hymns.The Fallen AngelThere\\'s not much smexyness in this story but what\\'s there was very sensual and beautifully written. This may sound a bit odd to you when I say that I LOVED their sexual tension and titillating chemistry, but I wasn\\'t really able to feel and understand their ILYs. It happened too fast and I just needed…more. I can\\'t even explain what was actually lacking. I just know, however, that something was missing. Maybe I just needed more relationship development because in the end everything felt a little bit too rushed and resolved quite conveniently.It was a taunt. A challenge.One he did not refuse. He set his lips to her breast, loving the little cry that escaped her as he worried that sacred skin, sucking low and soft until the cry became a moan in the dark room. He could not stop himself from pulling her closer, lifting her from her feet, wrapping her legs about his waist, worshipping her there in that room that rarely knew pleasure and too often knew pain.And then she\\'d released the strap altogether, her weight in his arms and her fingers in his hair, holding him tight against her, encouraging his caress, begging him for more, urging him to give her everything he could.To me the best aspect of No Good Duke Goes Unpunished is the sexy-as-sin hero Temple. He\\'s incredibly delicious and very sensual. It goes without saying that Temple is a somewhat dark, brooding and broken creature. One could think he lost his ability to smile and laugh. On the other hand, it\\'s not surprising because twelve years marked as a killer will change a man after all. What\\'s even better is the fact that he was a fighter and made good use of his fists in the ring. However, he doesn\\'t only strike with his fists, he\\'s also a ruler over thoughts and words. I think this was a battle of wits because both main protagonists have a sharp tongue and they really know how to use it. Temple repeatedly infuriates Mara with his quick mind and challenging demeanor. And once again the author achieved to write a somewhat different heroine. She might not go down in my book history as one of my favorite heroines, yet I really did like her. Plus, her background story was interesting. All in all the plot is a bit oppressive but the witty and compelling dialogue brightened the overall atmosphere of the story very nicely.\"And here I was, hoping you would give me a token to wear into battle.\"Her gaze narrowed. \"I ought to have your sabre tempered with.\"Temple raised a brow. \"Sabre tampering, is that how they refer to it at the MacIntyre Home for Boys?\"Bourne snickered, and Mara cut him a look. \"You are a marquess, are you not?\"I am.\"\"Tell me, do you ever act like it? I only ask because it does not seem that your friend cares much for behaving like a duke. I thought the immaturity was perhaps catching. Like influenza.Admiration flashed in Bourne\\'s gaze. He turned to Temple. \"Charming.\"\"And she\\'s armed with laudanum.\"Bourne nodded. \"I shan\\'t drink anything she gives me, then.\"\"And aknife,\"she added dryly.He raised a brow. \"And keep a vigilant watch.\"\"It\\'s an intelligent plan,\" Temple offered.\"Hebert made you a pocket?\"She narrowed her gaze on him through the mask. \"I thought I\\'d made it clear that I am quite skilled with a needle.\"He couldn\\'t stop the laugh that came then. The woman was remarkable. She\\'d received a dress that cost more than her salary for a year, and immediately installed a pocket tokeep her weapon close.He removed the knife and held it high above their heads. \"The lady is equipped with steel.\"In more ways than one.Minor quibblesI was surprised how fastTemple recovered after he\\'d been stabbed. He almost died and lost plenty of blood. Yet within a few days he was ready to give Mara an amazing BJ. Kudos, Temple! Whew.I love the author\\'s writing but the more I read the more irritated I became with all those one word, two word or three word sentences, i.e.Anger.Desperation.Frustration.Sadness.He loved her.Don\\'t get me wrong. Sometimes it works fine but there are situations where it\\'s downright annoying and it threw me out of the story.The final chapter was too corny for my liking. On the other hand I did enjoy the epilogue and I\\'m thrilled to read Chase\\'s storyNever Judge a Lady by Her Cover, coming in 2014.Despite my minor issues No Good Duke Goes Unpunished is a great addition to The Rules of Scoundrels series. It\\'s a well-written story about vengeance, redemption and absolution and a must read for every fan of Sarah MacLean. May Temple seduce all of you!Recommended read.http://baba.booklikes.com2 -- IT BREAKS MY HEART TO WRITE THIS --stars.I love Sarah MacLean, and I really wanted to like this, but the story was a big WTF?!!Words =/= actionsOh right... a guy hell bent on revenge and can only see his hate for this woman, buys her a new wardrobe and fusses over non stop?? WTF? Oh, how evil!! (NOT!)Selfish actions =/= I love youSo for a lady feeling guilty of framing the Duke for murder and causing him so much pain, she proves it by causing more pain and then more pain?And then everyone lives happily ever after?? WTF?When pigs fly (yes, they even had a pet pig in this story!)This was a bummer as I had been enjoying this series, but I am not calling it quits. On the plus side, Sarah MacLean is such a great writer she nearly had me buying this concocted story.

Therefore, when Sienna’s latest starring role takes her to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park she finds herself continually lost while trying to navigate the backroads of Green Valley, Tennessee. Much to her consternation, Sienna’s most frequent savior is a ridiculously handsome, charming, and cheeky Park Ranger by the name of Jethro Winston. Sienna is accustomed to high levels of man-handsome, so it’s not Jethro’s chiseled features or his perfect physique that make Sienna stutter. It’s his southern charm. And gentlemanly manners.

Her talent truly knows no bounds. Anytime I’m wanting a book that’s smart, funny, romantic and sweet I know just the author I want to read. I haven’t met a book of hers yet that I didn’t love. This one was extra special to me because I found the main chapters to be so relatable. To anyone who has ever felt like they’ve been labeled in the past, and they’re kind of stuck with that label- this is the book for you. Seriously, I just want to give a huge hug to Sienna and Jethro both. I adored them so much!Jethro Winston is the oldest of the Winston clan. He’s made some bad choices in his past, but they’ve shaped the great man he is now. Sienna Diaz is a comedian, actress, and writer. She’s big in Hollywood right now, but she’s not stuck up or snobby. In fact, she is the opposite of what you would consider a Hollywood girl. She’s down to earth, average sized, sweet and charming. And don’t forget funny- this girl will have you rolling with laughter! From the moment she and Jethro meet, their flirting is off the charts and fabulous.“Every step of the way I’d been scolded for being happy with myself. How dare I be happy with who I am, my size, the color of my skin, that I can make both men and women laugh.”I love that Jethro has no idea that Sienna is as famous as she is. That is exactly what she needs. Someone who sees her as her, just Sienna. Their relationship had a slow start. It was a friendship with a slow burn towards the romance side. The growth of their relationship was great to see. The way they learned to trust one another, and really truly fell for each other was beautiful.I was mad for him. Everything was grand. We were perfect together.Jethro and Sienna saw way beyond the labels that had been put on them from a young age. Jethro always felt like a disappointment to his family. He was a troublemaker as a kid and not the brother you could count on. Sienna was labeled as the funny one and that\\'s all she was to some people. They saw past that and to the heart of who one another truly was deep down. It was such a gorgeous thing.I cannot get enough of these Winston brothers. I am so excited to get each and every one of their books- but especially Cletus’s. There is just something about him that makes you love the guy! And I’m so interested in how his story will be! Also, after reading this one, I’m a little more intrigued to get Billy’s book… All these characters are so likable. I’m looking forward to them all!There are always so many ‘quotable’ lines in Penny’s books. Lines that make me say ‘Yes! This is so true!’ These are just a few of them :)“Think of how much better the world would be if people craved compliments about the beauty of their heart rather than the beauty of their face.”“It’s good to care, Sienna. It’s good to care about what others think, but only when those other people matter.”The best thing about a Penny book is that feeling I get when I start reading it. I never want to put it down and I’m always completely enraptured by the story. I read with the biggest smile on my face never wanting it to end. This has been true for every book of hers I’ve read, andGrin and Beard Itis no exception. I fell in love with Jethro and Sienna’s story. The perfect combination of humor, love, friendship, and family with fantastic smarts and wit, this is a must read and is going on my favorites list!penny reid is just... a genuinely fantastic romance authori didn\\'t know what i was getting myself into when i read the first book, and honestly i knew even less going into this one. was it going to be a tiredly trope-y attempt at a romance set in the south or was it going to be just as good as the first book in the series?rest assured, it was the latter. this book was a LOT of fun. i think penny reid has mastered the fluffy rom com. characters are INCREDIBLY unique and nuanced and all of the reasons they have for behaving the way they do make sense. which should be an obvious thing i guess when writing contemporary but so often i read romances and i\\'m like... the flavor is lacking and the decisions these people are making suck. not so in penny reid\\'s books.and i think it\\'s an incredibly big testament to her writing that she got me to care about a story with a famous character. i adored fame in my stories when i was a kid but over time i\\'ve sort of soured of that trope. but somehow it worked here. it never felt overwrought and it got me thinking about the complications of fame i\\'d never previously considered.the only thing that is keeping me from giving this book 5 stars though i think is the overall premise/characters. which sounds vague and contradictory and maybe it is. but while i sincerely appreciate and know objectively this was a great story, a story with a famous heroine and a reformed bad boy is never going to be a five star story for me. i am however THRILLED to check out the third book in this series. and i wouldn\\'t be surprised if i decided to read all of penny reid\\'s backlist asap.NOW LIVE!!!!Amazon:http://amzn.com/B01FTEWIBKBN:http://bit.ly/25i6rPzKobo:http://bit.ly/25i6WcviBooks:http://apple.co/1ViItkBSmashwords:http://bit.ly/1sQuOGq3.75 “put your best fuck forward” stars!“It’s good to care what other people think but only when those other people matter.”Grin and Beard It is the story of the eldest Winston brother Jethro, and Hollywood starlet and funny girl, Sienna. Sienna is a famous actress and comedian filming in Tennessee when she gets lost trying to locate the house she’s staying in. Ranger Jethro rescues her from the side of the road and the two hit it off right away.Both are hesitant to pursue the other, Sienna with her Hollywood career constantly interfering with her personal life. Jethro has a wild past he is ashamed of and made vows about the kind of man he wants to be. Both need to figure out a way to fit the other into their life plans, but the chemistry between them is potent and undeniable.“It felt real. He felt real. I loved that he was real.”I enjoyed this newest book from Penny Reid. It follows along the lines of a traditional romance, one with a sweet story and a slow burn. But while the romance itself is traditional, I felt there was a lot that was progressive about this story. For one, this is a movie star romance novel, but instead of the star being a man, it was a woman. Not only was she a star, but she also wrote her own movies and was Latina (something unfortunately hard to find in the white-washed genre of romance). I loved reading about Sienna because I love strong intelligent women who work hard for what they want instead of lying down and letting a man take charge.“Every step of the way I’d been scolded for being happy with myself. How dare I be happy with who I am, my size, the color of my skin, that I can make both men and women laugh.”The portrayal of Hollywood was something else I liked in this book. Growing up in LA I am pretty jaded about that whole industry and I hate how it’s glamourized. Yes there are positives to it, but many authors gloss over the negatives and Penny didn’t do this. Sienna’s career affected her daily life in ways we take for granted, such as how to look, act, eat, drink, speak and more. The fact that she was size 14 and working in Hollywood successfully is impressive to me because you don’t see that all too often.As per usual in Penny’s books, there’s sharp wit and humor laced throughout the story. I found myself laughing out loud at many points and smiling a lot as well. I wouldn’t say this is a romantic comedy but I think readers will connect with the humor spread throughout.“Where I\\'m from they call your kind a hipster or lumbersexual, with the beard and the flannel and such.”\"Ah. See, where I\\'m from, they call my kind a man.\"Side characters: Cletus gets MVP. Oh. My. Gawd. That man!!!!!! I need more Cletus in my life. I can’t ever put my finger down on what he will say or do next, or even what he is thinking. He managed to be a comedic relief, relationship guide, and a scary MoFo all at once! Also, I am dying to read Billy’s book. I’m not kidding, the wait for his book will be the death of me!“I think we all need someone who sees the best in us.”So why not a full five stars? Well, I blame it mostly on personal preferences. Sweet romance isn’t what I normally choose to read, and this book was fairly sweet and romancey. I also didn’t have that spark with it, the one you get when you absolutely love a book? Overall I liked this book, but it wouldn’t be my first choice to reread.Readers far and wide will love this book and these characters, Sienna and Jethro make a delightful couple many will enjoy. The Winston brothers are a fun and unique bunch and I find myself cursing my parents for making me an only child, even though I suspect my siblings wouldn’t be half as cool as these guys. If you want a book to curl up with on a rainy day with some tea, this is the book for you.“Jethro Winston was my forever person. I would never be strong enough to let him go.”ARC kindly provided by author in exchange for an honest reviewTitle:Grin and Beard ItSeries:Winston Brothers #2Author:Penny ReidRelease date:May 31, 2016Cliffhanger:NoHEAYesOh, my. If there was any doubt how much I loved these mischievous, rascally Winston brothers (there wasn\\'t) then this book would have clinched the matter. There is something so comforting about returning to this family that\\'s bursting with Southern charm and wisdom. I don\\'t think I could ever get enough of them. What I love about this series is that all seven Winston siblings come to life so vividly in their own special ways. They\\'re so delightful that they share the spotlight with the hero and heroine, I could never use the term \"secondary characters\" to describe them. They shine too brightly for that.The very first scene with Sienna is sure to make you fall in love with her. She\\'s a comedian, screenwriter, and actress who is attempting (unsuccessfully) to maneuver the Tennessee roads. This leads to a murderous rampage directed towards her map that had me laughing at her plight. Her wit, and her unpretentious inner thoughts were charming-shewas charming. Which made her the perfect match for her bearded rescuer, Jethro Winston. One flash of her dimples and his irresistible smile and they were both lost. They flirted like masters on a mission.These two begin a slow burn relationship that felt natural in its development. Though they had an intense, instant attraction they didn\\'t rush into anything based purely on lust. They were cautious and made rational, adult decisions about how to approach the possibility of dating. Sienna is a city girl, only in town temporarily for filming her latest movie. Jethro is born and bred in the country and planned on starting his own family there when the time came. He\\'s interested in dating with a future in mind. She...well, hasn\\'t wanted anything but casual in the past. She hasn\\'t found anyone to tempt her. Until Jethro.My despondency was borne from already feeling invested in a girl who had a history of not investing.They were naturally guarded at first, but eventually they came to see how desperately they needed each other. Being apart led to a constant ache on both sides that couldn\\'t be extinguished. There was nothing to alleviate the suffering except exploring the emotions that they had buried. Through communication and the very hilarious intervention of his brother Cletus, they set their reservations aside.Jethro has shown himself to be one of the most steadfast and humble of the brothers. His shameful past through the influence of his despicable father has made him eager to be the brother that everyone can now depend on. He was the oldest, but instead of protecting his brothers growing up, he perpetuated the the trouble their father brought on them. This is something that he can\\'t, andwon\\'tforgive himself for. I really felt his remorse, and his need to make amends was a sign that he had truly matured past his own mistakes.Seeing how each of their lingering labels acquired from childhood affected each other was a healing balm for both of them. They were free to shed their superficial pretenses and grow together as a couple. They saw each other in a light that no one else could.Being Sienna Diaz, movie star, was easy. Tiring, but easy. It was a role, a mask I could slip on at will. Being myself wasn\\'t usually as easy. Jethro had made it easy for me, which was one of the reasons I loved being around him.There is such a feeling of completeness when these two are around one another, a feeling as if being together made them more whole and at ease within themselves. And Jethro was so tender and passionately adoring of Sienna, he never failed to capture my heart.\"You are so beautiful,\" he said, his attention from my hair to my neck and chin. \"I don\\'t think I knew what beauty was, until I met you.\"This book was delightfully drama free. Not to say there wasn\\'t conflict, but it was based on realistic concerns and not born out of manufactured situations. The brothers added an amusing layer of shenanigans that was such diverting fun. Personally, my favorite brother is Billy and I was thrilled to see more of his story unfold on the sidelines. I cannot wait to hear more about him and get the missing pieces filled in with his future book.If you\\'re going into this story looking for something witty, enchanting, and entertaining you\\'ll get everything you bargained for. The bearded brothers have done it again, be prepared to be dazzled in all of their bearded glory.FOLLOW SMOKIN HOT BOOK BLOG ON:'}, {'title': 'Daughter of Smoke & Bone #3Dreams of Gods & Monsters', 'author': 'Laini Taylor', 'summary': \"What power can bruise the sky?Two worlds are poised on the brink of a vicious war.

It sang of tremulous shadows and evenings past, of urban gunpowder and decay. In trembling hands, the reader held it. Alas, not the moon but something better. The solid weight of the book, after months of yearning and patient waiting. A creep of color in her cheeks, an imperceptible shiver of anticipation. Finally. She held it, not daring to believe -- but unable to stem the tide of hope and eagerness. It felt heavy. Six hundred and thirteen pages.An ending. A beginning. A dream.Of God and Monsters. The uncommon love story held within the desperately thick hardcover beckoned. She unfurled in her couch and began reading beside a steaming cup of decaffeinated tea that hinted of cinnamon and apples, of autumn long past.Would there ever again be such an autumn, she wondered absently, for a moment, before the tide of language pulled her under.On and on she read. Akiva was manly but also beautiful. She was reminded repeatedly that his eyes were fire. Godstars and silverdust,they were fire.And Karou was a woman independent, strong, and brave. She led an army of revenants but she burned in the flames of Akiva’s eyes and his devotion to her, which knew no bounds. Karou stood fast, gulped, and joined her eyes with Akiva’s. In the known universe, there was nothing like these two sets of eyeballs, the same yet different.The eyeballs of Akiva and Karou.Each contained such intensity, grief, and resplendence, that the universe was destroyed and reborn each time their gazes locked. It was a thing indescribable in language. But the author tried anyway, over three books that sung with grief and hope. Across the nation, readers held their faces to the glimmering night sky and wept. They wept tears of moonshine and starlight. And they read.After the universe reconstituted itself in the wake of Akiva and Karou’s soul-shattering look, the nature of their gazes … shifted. Karou’s was vivid, hopeful, searching. Akiva’s was troubled, unsure, and angry at the devastation he had caused her people. In a voice that was low and sweet and rough with love, he spoke: “hello.” Her hair was a shimmer of blue and her cream-colored face flushed and he thought,Gods, she was so beautiful.“Hi,” she said, and the word was a wisp and it brushed against his skin, soft as the caresses they had once shared before their worlds were torn asunder by a knowledge neither of them could ever unknow. As they looked on at each other, it seemed as though all the words in all the languages in all the worlds had been extinguished in the bright blaze of their love. What was there to say? But the ugly shadow of Thiago and his attempted brutalization of Karou hung low in the air between them, even lower than the moon outside the reader’s window. A very masculine rage tore through Akiva’s chest and threatened to blind him.I should have been there to protect you,he said, his voice choked with sorrow. The emotion in his voice seared its way through his body, and his chest rippled, slightly and gently as the leaves of a summer tree. Karou, strong and self-sufficient, said shortly, “I protected myself,” but her eyes were bright with tears. Outside, clouds were gathering. Clouds of hope and heartache.But then the unthinkable happened. At the corner of the reader’s eye, a vibration. She turned and saw her iphone blinking the way it did only when someone was calling her. It was like a kick to her heartbeat, that burning light. The screen shone yellow-green, then sparked and blazed like a star calling out to the heavens. It was mom. Dear gods and stardust. She felt…exposed. Torn. An age-old conflict churned inside her: answer the call of duty or continue being caressed by the firelit words of the moonheavy book. Moments passed but seemed like years, like an eternity. She made her decision. She reached over and with the sly cunning of a fox, pressed a button that would silence the ring and as she did, revealed a smile like a lovechild of a shark and scimitar.She drowned again. The author’s tortured prose opened its arms, and the reader fell into that lunatic embrace, an unwilling captive, and the world fell away around her.Oh, Akiva. Oh, Karou. Oh, two halves of one soul, their destiny written in war and blood. Oh, tears.The reader was dimly aware that plot and pacing were pitch-perfect, that occasional characters were well-drawn, and that the setting was still interesting. But in the end, these things were known and buried under prose that shone unbearably purple in the starlight, growing brighter and brighter like a wounded star in the night sky until there was nothing left of the dream of god and monsters, and of the reader\\'s patience which lay in pieces on the desolate wasteland of her bedroom floor.4.25Really enjoyed it but I should have completed this series sooner!\"I heard the owls in Africa have lady heads.\"And so ends one of the most fascinating YA Fantasy series I\\'ve come across this year. To be honest, many positive opinions notwithstanding, I always had the foreboding that this series might not turn out well. But Laini Taylor exceeded all my expectations by concluding the series with this lengthy, but thrilling last book.\"This needs to be witnessed, and spoken of far and wide. Sung.\"\"Beautiful interspecies badass seeks, um... non-mortal enemy for uncomplicated courtship.\"It would be repetitive to appreciate Laini Taylor\\'s storytelling, world building, or the character development anymore. She\\'s awesome at each of these things and I\\'ve said enough on that in my earlier reviews. But what I cannot get enough of is her prose. It feels quite poetic, which is not something one would expect in a fantasy series, making the reading experience very entertaining. She has a very unique way with the words.\"Declaring an end and achieving an end were different animals.\"I was not expecting to see any new characters here, at least major ones, but the author gives us a brand new plotline again. led by a new key character. I was a bit confused at start, for, I thought it to be a gamble to use such a tactic at this point of the story. But it all came very well together towards the end, with Taylor bringing all those seemingly independent plot lines to one. And I\\'m really happy with the ending. She had found a solid middle ground, with sufficient amount of disappointment to make everything seem tangible, while delivering a satisfying conclusion. As I said before, I did not get in to this series with a lot of expectations. But after this trilogy, I believe it\\'s safe to say, Laini Taylor has become one of my favorite fantasy writers. I hope Strange The Dreamer would keep the momentum going.\"Ignorance and power. They\\'re a poor combination.\"Reread with friends over at For Love Of A Book.CHECK OUT MY WALL ART OF KAROUI\\'m so happy with this ending ❤Karou and Akiva must find a way to bring the beasts and angels together to fight against the evil angels. It\\'s hard work but they manage to get it done with a few rough starts and stops. They have some help with a secret Karou is carrying.What a brilliant author Laini Taylor is to come up with the worlds that she does.There is also another character that has a very interesting (to put it mildly) part in the book. Her name is Eliza. I enjoyed her character quite a bit.Karou\\'s best friends, Zuzana and Mik are in the middle of it all. Just two small humans in an unhuman world. I love them so much and they were great through the whole thing. They also brought many comedic moments.Liraz is there and hating stuff as much as always but she is there for her brother Akiva. BUT, she does show a sweet side when no one is looking and she gets a crush that will turn to love. I was so happy and it was lovely how sweet they were together. NO, I\\'m not saying who it is.Ziri is there, another one of Karou\\'s best friends but he was a monster like her. I don\\'t like calling them monsters because they were the good monsters but that\\'s how we keep them separate. Ziri rising above and beyond the call of duty to help both the seraphim and chimaera! I loved him so much. He put himself in a very precarious situation and he rocked it. And, oh the outcome, he was perfect and he finally got what he wanted in life. Not what he thought in the beginning, but even more. ♥I loved the books in this trilogy. I loved all of the creatures and I WISH there was a graphic novel or some kind of artwork book of all the creatures. They were just so awesome sounding. Actually, I would like to see this trilogy as a movie too, as long as they didn\\'t mess it up.

Floods sweep away entire villages, while bloody wars are waged over the few remaining resources. Her people believe the Sea God, once their protector, now curses them with death and despair. In an attempt to appease him, each year a beautiful maiden is thrown into the sea to serve as the Sea God’s bride, in the hopes that one day the “true bride” will be chosen and end the suffering.Many believe that Shim Cheong, the most beautiful girl in the village—and the beloved of Mina’s older brother Joon—may be the legendary true bride. But on the night Cheong is to be sacrificed, Joon follows Cheong out to sea, even knowing that to interfere is a death sentence. To save her brother, Mina throws herself into the water in Cheong’s stead.Swept away to the Spirit Realm, a magical city of lesser gods and mythical beasts, Mina seeks out the Sea God, only to find him caught in an enchanted sleep.

Axie Oh’s characters own my whole heart.\"I was angry, but not at you. I was angry at the fate I\\'d been given. Because I realized that for you to have what you want, I\\'d have to lose the only thing I\\'d ever wanted\"I dare to bet that by the end of the story, Shin will have massive back pain for how much he carried this whole book! I need the police to launch a full federal investigation into the grip Axie Oh has on me by introducing Shin, considering how he wasn\\'t given much limelight. Added that this is also a single POV — but Shin surely had me on a clutch. All the only reasons why I rated higher than it should be.The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea was told to be inspired by a Korean myth and Ghibli\\'s Spirited Away. And being the big fan that I am of Ghibli, of course I wouldn\\'t want to miss this. Undeniably, this book did offer us a very interesting premise. The concept is fluid where the characters are pushed out of comfortable homes to go make new lives elsewhere in the world. I love the settings and vibe as it is often whimsical, nostalgic, and full of wonder about the world. It fits my preferences.Alas, I do feel like Axie Oh too had a lot in mind on what or how this should be but does not know when to execute them. I have a lot of questions throughout the book but the part when it was revealed does not help me a bit in getting them answered. The writing was confusing and very layman, to a point, it does feel like reading a MG book. It was very amateur at most — from the heroine, the villain, the romance to the worldbuilding. Though, it\\'s a great place to start an outlet for creativity and a decent crucible to craft better stories; given this is only one of the two works of her so far.Nevertheless, I still have to list what of this book that does not seem to work out.1) Our protagonist, Mina.We’ve all read a novel where the protagonist starts seemingly completely normal until they’re suddenly thrust into a new world and discover that only they have the power to fix the universe. Mina is no less the same, the ever so virtuous girl who doesn\\'t feel pretty and to an extent, can be overbearing.There are a plethora of other tropes in YA fiction and just because it was overdone, does not mean authors should steer clear of it because when it was done well — it can be good. Just... not Mina. Sometimes I wonder why Axie Oh didn\\'t just stick with Sim Cheong as the Sea Bride just like the myth since the story seems to revolve quite a lot around Sim Cheong. Taking into consideration that she\\'s a supporting character that is barely significant. It just doesn\\'t add up. Though, I understand if she\\'s trying to remodel and offer a different alternative from the original piece. Axie Oh just had a poor way to portray it.2) The world-building.This book has the potential to be amazing but there were too many details that were left out. Worlds are systems but most of the time, I had no idea what the Lords and Goddesses were supposed to serve nor were they given a delineation to their existence. What\\'s the Spirit Realm in profundity or the motives of the villains? Like, why does the House of Crane and Tiger wants to kill Shin and had the Imugi do that? Why do they even have ill intentions towards Sea God? You can’t just pigeonhole people into being evil. Heritage or class isn’t what makes someone “bad” or the “villain” — it’s their motives and thoughts that do. So when Axie just writes them as evil because they’re associated with someone that is, I feel like she\\'s not giving justice to her characters.I also don\\'t truly understand why Shin and Mina were bounded in the first place despite the revelation in the end. Everything is tied but at the same time, they are not. How can the Goddess of Moon and Memory takes place of the Goddess of Motherhood and Children just because Mina said she had it in her to be kind? What happened to the real Goddess of Motherhood and Children? No longer a goddess? Or mayhaps Axie Oh just forgot of her total existence, I bet.Why does Shin suddenly forget Mina when spirits don\\'t forget when they turned one? Why did the Sea God lose his memories when he offered his soul to the Emperor? Who made them forget? No, listen, the list is just neverending which only concludes that this book has such poor worldbuilding. The short pages probably didn\\'t help too, because it does feel rushed.3) The writing styleNot gonna lie. This book pretty much checks all the boxes of what sticks as an amateur. The conversation was so calculated and unnatural. I bet if it\\'s a real-life conversation, it\\'s just gonna be crickets because it was so awkward 💀 The way it continues does not have the string that should tell it was a linkage to a previous conversation. Things happen without a logical reason (this is a retold myth, it shouldn\\'t be logical! I know, but at least try to connect the dot and make it more believable).4) RomanceIt\\'s no news that I love Shin; but do I enjoy the romance? Fairly so. There wasn\\'t enough build-up between Shin and Mina. They didn\\'t start on a good foot until they were bounded. And later, they fell in love... like are they really in love? Or the prospect of them being soulmates is what makes them fall in love. We never know. I don\\'t feel the connection.As for the age gap? Yeah, I kinda get that this is fantasy and we have lots of romance with such big age gap but considering that Mina is a 16 years old is kind of... off-putting. Still and all, I stand with my viewpoint that Shin hard carried the book! He\\'s swoon-worthy when he\\'s whipped. Like, we love a man who is whipped, even when thing is incoherent 😭Now, look at that. I did go to the extreme with the rant. I mean, I can be forceful sometimes just to make a point. It\\'s not like this book is not good, it is enjoyable! The secondary characters are lovable too (Namgi, Kirin, Nari, Mask, Dai — I\\'m looking at you!!) It was just a bummer that it did not carry through as it should have.In spite of that, if you\\'re looking for a story full of love, found family tropes, East-Asian folklore stories, and slow-burn romances, this review should not deter you from starting it!'}, {'title': 'Eliza and Her Monsters', 'author': 'Francesca Zappia', 'summary': 'Her story is a phenomenon.

The only reason it\\'s not 5 is that it took a little while for me to get into it. But when I did,it completely blew me away. I liked this even more than Zappia\\'sMade You Up.I\\'m not going to lie to you - a huge part of my love for this book is because I related so much to Eliza. So freaking much. Well, except for the part where she\\'s a talented webcomic artist and I\\'m not, but shhh.Some of you know this, but others don\\'t-- I have long suffered with anxiety, particularly social anxiety. I get worked up about sending emails, angsting over it when replies don\\'t come straight away (oh god, did I say something wrong?). I literally used to drink alcohol before the mandatory presentations in college (not showing up only worked for so long), and I still feel panic rising inside me whenever I have to make a phone call to someone I don\\'t know well. Over the years, I\\'ve come to handle it better; to talk myself down from the panic. But it\\'s still there.It\\'s been part of who I am my whole life. From my very first school years when I almost always played alone, to later bullying because I was that \"weird\" and socially clueless class member who didn\\'t get how to behave. And the way I coped? To put it simply -The Internet. The Internet provided a place for me to explore the world, find others like me, whilst also providing a barrier. I was invisible, free, and not alone in the way I was often alone in the real world.I spent hours every night on my computer, until my parents got frustrated that I spent so much time alone and not in the \"real world\". What they didn\\'t get - and what Eliza\\'s parents don\\'t get in this book - is that I wasn\\'t alone. I was making friends from all over the world. And they were better friends than any I\\'d had in \"real life\" at that point. And, as Eliza says:It’s stupid because that’s what I like about the internet—that it gives you time to think about what you want to say before you say it.It\\'s always so wonderful to find a book that \"gets\" you. A book that puts into words feelings you\\'ve always had but have struggled to voice.Eliza and Her Monstersdid just that.From my perspective, it\\'s a very realistic portrayal of anxiety, and of someone who escapes into Internet forums. Eliza\\'s most valued friendships are online and, of course, her well-meaning parents fail to understand or consider them \"real\".It\\'s amuch darker bookthan I was first expecting. While there is lots of geeky fandom, fanfiction, fanart, cosplay... the story of Eliza\\'s anxiety, relationships with those around her, and even suicidal thoughts, gives the novel a more serious and emotional edge. I appreciate books like this, though. If you\\'re looking for a geeky fandom book that is lighter and fluffier, I recommendQueens of Geek.There is a small monster in my brain that controls my doubt.The doubt itself is a stupid thing, without sense or feeling, blind and straining at the end of a long chain. The monster, though, is smart. It’s always watching, and when I am completely sure of myself, it unchains the doubt and lets it run wild. Even when I know it’s coming, I can’t stop it.There\\'s another layer to this book, too, which I found really interesting. As well as being about Eliza\\'s anxiety, it\\'s also about an issue that is becoming ever more relevant today, and it\\'s an issue that I don\\'t recall reading anything about before-- the relationship between an artist and their fans. Or, really, anyone with a fan following.As Eliza becomes more popular online, the thing she did for herself, for her own escapism, becomes about other people and what they expect from her. People start to expect a certain type of work and feel like her popularity means she owes the world (and them) something. This opens a fascinating discussion on what artists/writers/etc. owe their fans or followers. Whether, in fact, they owe them anything.Creating art is a lonely task, which is why we introverts revel in it, but when we have fans looming over us, it becomes loneliness of a different sort. We become caged animals watched by zoo-goers, expected to perform lest the crowd grow bored or angry. It’s not always bad. Sometimes we do well, and the cage feels more like a pedestal.It was honestlysuch an interesting and thoughtful book. On many levels. It manages to be very emotionally moving, entertaining, beautifully-illustrated AND do something new at the same time.Eliza and Her Monstersdeserves all of the hype.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|YoutubeI took waaaaay too long to finish this book, but I honestly don\\'t have any regrets about that. I actually think it lined up perfectly with something I\\'m facing in my own life right now, that\\'s similar to what Eliza faced with being a creator online. I feel so connected and understood by this story and I\\'m glad I finally worked myself up to finishing it.I finished a book for the first time in more than a month!!! Yay!!!!This was such a good read! It was so much more than I was expecting and just gripped me right from the beginning. Loved it!in a friendly reminder that i\\'ve sh*t on all your faves, i posted this review!! find it here (preferably before unfollowing me out of righteous fury):https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...------------Hindsight is 20/20.I now understand, having read this book, what I did not grasp previously: that maybe I shouldn’t have expected to like this.For one thing, I full on hate Francesca Zappia’s other book with everything that I am, which in retrospect is seeming like a more important factor than it did at the time.I also really, really hate my-big-secret-was-revealed-and-now-everyone-in-high-school-knows-and-my-life-is-ruined-in-a-very-quintessentially-high-school-way plotlines. They are so stressful.But I like contemporaries! And I like the Internet! And I like illustrations! And I like mental illness rep! And I like books people like! (That first and last one are blatantly false, but still.)I had hope, is what I’m saying.This book crushed every last BIT of that.As I just ranted about (except not actually because it’ll probably take me a million years to post this, even after it took me a million years to write it, even after it took me a million years to read the book) in my review ofEverything All at Once,I am sick to death of the sh*tty family trope.But I didn’t realize just how sick of it I could be, just how hard that trope could scrape against the bottom of the entertainment barrel, just how low we could get, until I read this book.THIS BOOK HAS PERHAPS THE WORST FAMILY DYNAMIC OF ANY BOOK I’VE EVER READ. Because not only is it grueling and dramatic and boring and done, it’s also completely nonsensical.Eliza has two little brothers, who are so flat and annoying they actually go well past the bounds of the very definitions of the words “flat” and “annoying.” She does not get along well with said brothers, and is, in fact, quite mean to them despite being many years older and, one would suppose (incorrectly), more mature. So that’s awesome.But we don’t get to the very limits of terrible until we talk about Eliza’s parents. That statement, along with every single statement made in this book, may lead you to assume that Eliza’s parents are the problem. However, every single cell in my entire body vehemently disagrees with that assumption.Eliza’s parents are just two people trying their best!!!!!! Their daughter never talks to them and spends her whole life in her room, on the Internet, and they don’t know what to do about it which is not exactly shocking considering Eliza never talks to them!!!!! They’re just trying to parent!!!!!I think this book may have been designed to appeal to the children of technology. Here is a girl who has it all, in terms of what the online world can offer: she has anxiety, but she’s unbelievably famous, has swarms of online friends, creates amazing art, gets a boyfriend. What goes along with that is the inevitable disapproving parental figure is actually - gasp! - wrong.Maybe that’s another reason I was destined not to like this book: I firmly believe you can’t be on the internet all the time. Not even if your friends are on there, not even if your job is on there, not even if, like, a goddamn opportunity to hook up with Zac Efron is on there. Which I guess it is, technically speaking. REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, the real world matters too, is what I’m saying.I firmly believe that Eliza should have apologized to her parents. She doesn’t talk to them unless she’s spewing vitriol, she ignores her family, she stays in her room all the time, she refuses to even offer an explanation as to why all of this would be okay. Once she does - sorry, once her brothers dofor her- good ol’ mom and dad are more than understanding.I gave this book the benefit of the doubt forSO LONGbecause I thought character development would change the way she treats her family but nOOO, HER PARENTS WERE ACTUALLY IN THE WRONG ALL ALONG, AND IN TURN SO WAS I, MOTHER AND FATHER AND I ARE JUST THREE MORE FOOLS INHABITING THIS WORLD OF FURY AND NONSENSE.Not even the fun Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland kind.In the abundant free time Eliza doesn’t spend creating an inexplicably famous and successful web comic or ruining the lives of her family members, she’s living it up sexual tension-wise with a kid named Wallace.I support this relationship, but only because Eliza and Wallace both suck so equally that they were probably made for each other. They treat each other like sh*t, and Wallace is so boring. Like seriously. Guys. This is your MCM?Eliza stupidly hides the fact that she writes that massively successful web comic from Wallace, even though Wallace is a huge fan of it and talks to her about it all the time and revealedhissecret online identity toher. But whatever, of course that is what would happen in a book this trope-y.HOWEVER. Here’s the thing. Eliza and Wallace write notes to each otherall the time(like straight up instead of talking). Eliza also handwrites the speech bubbles for her comic, which Wallace is obsessed with. Like photographic-memory-level-of-knowledge obsessed.Can Wallace not recognize handwriting?There’s a moment when Eliza recognizes Wallace’s after seeing it ONE TIME.This book is dumb and I hate it.Good mental illness rep, though. If only everything else didn’t suck so hard.Bottom line: This book is designed to speak to its audience, and that high-as-hell average rating tells me it worked. BUT NOT FOR ME. SORRY, FOLKS.------------PRE-REVIEWGuys…I mean...come on.Like...what the ever-living hell…?God.Review to comeUPDATE: $2.99 Kindle US today 9/12/19I got some wonderful stuff in the mail yesterday (7/3/17) and I love them! I love getting stuff from the pub etc.I loved this book so very much!*****There will be some spoilers because I can\\'t help myself*****I love the book has drawings and stories all through-out the book. They are so awesome!I love Eliza. She\\'s quiet, wants to be left alone in her online world where she writes her webcomic: Monstrous Sea. She has two wonderful friends online that have helped her with her business. There is Max who runs security on the trolls (we need him for GR) and Emmy who set up the merch for the comic and sales for the comic, etc. Eliza makes enough money to live off of and put her way through college. She famous and she\\'s anonymous.I do have friends. Maybe they live hundreds of miles away from me, and maybe I can only talk to them through a screen, but they\\'re still my friends. They don\\'t just hold Monstrous Sea together. They hold me together.Max and Emmy are the reason any of this exists.Eliza doesn\\'t talk to people at school. Some people are actually afraid of her and she\\'s happy with this because all she want\\'s is to draw out her next parts for the comic during school. Then when she gets home she puts the drawings and stuff on her photoshop to get it complete and uploads them.God, I wish I could draw and do something so freaking cool like that. Anyhoo . . .Eliza isn\\'t really close to her parents. They are always trying to get her to do sports and random stuff she has no interest in. They think her comic is a hobby, she never told them how famous or how much money she makes. They think she makes a little bit of money and just let her do it. I do wish that Eliza would have been up front with them and I do wish that her parents would have taken the time to actually go online and read her comic and see how famous she actually was, but none of this happened. And later on, it bites them all in the butt.Eliza has two brothers: Church and Sully. She doesn\\'t do much with them because they are into sports etc. She has no idea that they follow her comic and so do their friends. And when Church takes up for Eliza when her parent do something extremely stupid, I was so proud. I mean so proud. He put them in their place once and for all because sometimes parents aren\\'t always right, even if they mean well.I must also mention that I\\'m in love with Davy, their Great Pyrenees =)Moving on.Eliza meets the new kid at school, Wallace. He starts writing notes to her because he doesn\\'t really like to talk. It\\'s really super cute and he\\'s freaking hot. Just sayin\\'. It turns out that he writes fanfiction for Eliza\\'s comic!They become close and start going out which is way beyond anything Eliza has ever done in her life! I think they are wonderful together but she never tells him that she is LadyConstellation and the creator of Monstrous Sea. I wanted to scream! He finds out when every one else does when her parents do something stupid. Poor Emmy and Max have to try to fight and keep everyone off Eliza\\'s back and even Church cusses people to leave her alone. Eliza has a breakdown after her cover is blown and doesn\\'t even want to finish her comic. She has to see a counselor and take anxiety meds, it\\'s all just one big mess. If her parents would have just butted out and if Eliza would have just told them how big she is. . . so many things.Wallace gets mad at her obviously. I mean she should have told him but it is what it is. He gets even more mad at her when she decides she\\'s not going to finish the comic because he has an offer to get his fan fiction published. It could make his dreams come true as well. I find it strange that people can make money off other people\\'s work but I guess that\\'s life.Some drastic things make everything come to a close and the world to be complete again. Eliza is even closer to her family and things are awesome with Wallace. It was a happy ending for all involved.I really wish this book would continue or maybe a little novella of what happens with everyone later on.This book was so awesome to me and it meant a lot on so many levels. It\\'s a really great thing when a book can make you feel so good. FinMY BLOG:Melissa Martin\\'s Reading List'}, {'title': 'Weathermages of Mystral #1The Winter King', 'author': 'C.L.

But though peace is finally at hand, Wynter's battle with the Ice Heart, the dread power he embraced to avenge his brother's death, rages on.Khamsin Coruscate, Princess of Summerlea and summoner of Storms, has spent her life exiled to the shadows of her father's palace. Reviled by her father, marriage to Wintercraig's icy king was supposed to be a terrible punishment, but instead offers Kham her first taste of freedom—and her first taste of overwhelming passion.As fierce, indomitable Wynter weathers even Khamsin's wildest storms, surprising her with a tenderness she never expected, Kham wants more than Wynter's passion—she yearns for his love. But the power of the Ice Heart is growing, dangerous forces are gathering, and a devastating betrayal puts Khamsin and Wynter to the ultimate test.\", 'rating': '4.01', 'reviews': \"First things first!do NOT let this COVER mislead you!it's better than that, dammitThis is an actual world BUILDING, character DEVELOPING, son oF a BITCH NOVEL THAT I FUCKING LOVEMeetKhamShe went through so much shit but remained headstrong and fierce.

There is all kinds ofback stabbing, evil cunning plots,beaststrying to kill peeps, near death experiences, a quest to get themagical sword, defeat everyone, andsexy timesand just awesomeness!Now our love interestWynter!! King of Wintercraig. Like jesus christ guy it combines my two favorite things WINTER & WOLVES bitches! The king is already a legend among his people but all magic comes with a cost…Wynter is not even close to perfect. He got an alpha temper to rival the best of assholes. He comes across as harsh while trying to protect everyone. But goddamn he got the fucking hot barbarian thing going for him and it WORKS“Her eyes narrowed, beginning to swirl with silver. “You. Wouldn’t. Dare.”“Oh, min ros, I would.” He crossed his arms over his chest. “Wrestling a beautiful, naked woman out of her furs and into her bath? What Winterman worth his stones would pass up a chance like that?”I wouldkillfor this man.I would straight up murder any hoes that got near him, any dicks that dared threaten him, boii i will fuck you up if you even look at him funny“ She could sense its presence now, as if some part of the sun had broken off and fallen into the well.... Now, she just had to retrieve it.”Theworld-buildingso incredibly good, avoiding cliches of purple prose. New creatures, freaking weather patterns, local customs, everything just so freaking amaze. I loved walking around the villages, sneaking in the castles, and discovering new places with Kham“A giant ice wolf, they called it,” Kham muttered as she scrambled up the tree. “Ice wolf, my ass. Show me one wolf—just one!—that can climb a tree!”Now the romance...“Do that again,” she mumbled. “Feels nice.” She was rewarded by more cooling kisses against her closed eyelids and hot brow. “I’ll be fine in a few minutes. I’m stronger than I look.”“I know, min ros. I know.” Wynter’s husky voice whispered in her ear. “Tomorrow, you’ll be ready to fight Frost Giants barehanded, but for now, just rest.”oh. my FUCKING GOD ITWAS ADORABLEI just love thebalancein their relationship, Wynter knows she powerful AS FUCK and thinks its freaking awesome but also cares for her and helps her when she uses up all her power. She isn’t some dainty flower and he just loves every part of her and WHERE THE HELL IS MY WYNTER?“Something missing. Something important. Not her. Wasn’t her.Where was she”“Was this one her?The scent of lemon verbena filled his nostrils. Fear and fury swept through him in equal measure.Not her!

I could literally feelthe goddamn chemistry. Wynter and Kham are drawn to each other but goddamn do they fight it. It was delicious torture, i loved from start to finishI’m not crying YOURE CRYING“She was his wife, his queen, his mate. His heart.And he loved her.He loved every exasperating, fiery, rebellious, beautiful, challenging, volatile inch of her.”Fuck it, im cryingI loved ALL these characters— main and secondary just so well developed. I instantly loved Kham and Wynter, their strengths and weakness andoh god the sass“I’ve no idea why Freika ever bothered creating men. She should have recognized perfection when she created woman and stopped while she was ahead.”I mean.... where’s the lie though hahahaOverall. Read the book. Just. Read. The. Goddamn. Book.Reread! 💕OMG!I'm so in love with this book! I love Wynter who is the King of Wintercraig. I love that he is an ice king with some abilities. I love that his wilderness companions are wolves. He's everything! Two of my favorite things: WINTER & WOLVESSo this twat of a prince from Summerlea comes over to visit Wyn and he ends up stealing some important things, well one was not so important, and kills his brother, so this sets off a 3 year war. Wyn does some things to make himself stronger and full of hate and it could take him over completely. He crushes Summerlea in the war, yay. Wyn and some men then go on a visit to see the king of Summerlea and make his demands. This includes some stuff but the most important was that he would be taking home one of the king's daughters to marry. There is a stipulation with that but I won't tell you.While Wyn is there he meets Khamsin (Storm) (Kham) by accident. Well, their magics merge and it's like crazy train.I felt sorry for Kham because she was kept away as a prisoner since she was a child and never acknowledged as the kings daughter after something happens. He's a big freaking jerk that man!Anyway, Wyn is tricked into marrying Kham after her father almost kills her < -- read the book. But, Wyn isn't upset by this when he finds out who he is married to, the girl he met briefly and couldn't stop thinking about.They make their way back to king Wynter's home, but it takes awhile as Kham almost dies for reasons.Kham isn't made to feel welcome in the castle, of course, but over time most of the people come to love her because she is awesome! She's not like her sorry brother or father. Her sisters are nice like her too, btw.There is all kinds of bad stabbing, evil cunning plots, beasts trying to kill peeps, near death experiences, a quest to get the sword, defeat everyone that needs defeating, sexy times and oh so much more and I LOVE IT! I'm so happy with this book ♥Happy Reading!Mel ♥MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading ListReviewed by:Rabid ReadsC.L. Wilson writes Fantasy Romance like nobody’s business.I discovered Wilson’sTairen Soulseries a little over a year ago through a Goodreads’ recommendation, and I read all five books in five days.All five books. In five days.And they weren’t filler books either. They were all 400(ish) page FANTASY books.When I finished my reading binge, I was glad to see that another book was in the works—The Winter King(this book), and I’ve had it on my watchlist since January of last year.And people . . . it did NOT disappoint.Khamsin Coruscate is the unwanted daughter of King Verdan IV of Summerlea. Unacknowledged, she roams the abandoned places of her father’s castle, desperately trying to be good enough, noble enough, worthy enough to gain her father’s affections.All of her efforts are for naught.Wynter Atrialan is the young King of Wintercraig. Barely into manhood, he is already a legend among his people, having single-handedly killed a Frost Giant in a successful attempt to save his younger brother. But when he is betrayed, he embraces an ancient, dangerous magic to assist him in his quest for revenge.But the magic has a cost, and the longer Wynter uses it, the higher the price.Things I loved about this book:1. The characters—ALL of the characters, main and secondary alike, were incredibly well-developed. I felt an instant connection to both Wynter and Khamsin, and the secondary characters were both likable and entertaining while enhancing my understanding of the MCs.2. The world-building—Time wasn’t wasted describing actual landmasses, so while I may have only had a vague understanding of where Summerlea, Wintercraig, and Calbernan would be located on a map, I did gain knowledge of the other (more important IMO) aspects of the geography. I knew what creatures lurked where. I knew the weather patterns and the local customs. The imports and exports, etc. All those details combined to create a clear picture of Kham and Wyn’s world.3. Villainous villains—I love to hate a good villain. Oh, I like a sympathetic villain on occasion as well, but sometimes a clear-cut bad guy is a wonderful target for your animosity, andThe Winter Kinghas several.4. The ROMANCE—Wynter and Khamsin are instantly drawn to each other and have incredible chemistry, but oh, how they fight it. There are numerous misunderstandings and miscommunications (for the path to true love never did run smooth), but the journey never crosses the line from swoonfest to tedium. It’s very simply delicious torture.5. Possibility of future books from this world—As far as I can tell, there are currently no other books from this world under contract. BUT Wilson lays the groundwork for several future books throughout this one, and my fingers are crossed that said books will come to pass (Dilys Merimydion + a Season = True Love 4-Ever).Things I could have liked more:1. Too many villainous villains—There were at least four significant bad guys (as well as several other characters you were made to be suspicious of), and as effective as they were, I can’t help but think that cumulatively a few less would have made even more of an impact. Even if there were still a few secondary bad guys all working for one Big Bad<——Big Bad is singular for a reason.2. So very LONG—I kind of feel like this book could have had 100 less pages and still accomplished everything that needed to be accomplished. The end seemed to drag a bit (but only a bit). That being said, all of those pages flew by.But ultimately, a couple of minor issues were not enough to keep me from absolutely loving this book.Fantasy romance is not a big genre, so finding an author who excels at writing it ishighlyfortuitous. C.L. Wilson is one such author, and this book perfectly illustrates that claim. With a completely enthralling combination of fantastical elements and a swoonworthy romance, I recommendThe Winter Kingto lovers of both Fantasy and Paranormal Romance. C.L. Wilson is always a safe bet, andThe Winter Kingis perhaps my favorite of her books to date.Be sure to check out theAuthor Interviewon the blog post!3 starsThis started out so strong and I was enjoying the plot, all because of the forced marriage trope tho, but then it started dragging and things were just so repetitive. The entire book is filled with them not trusting each other and throwing accusations. They just didn’t give me a chance to connect with both of them. Even at the very end both the main characters were still throwing accusations of betrayals at each other! The world building was good and some parts were really enjoyable tho. I think I just came here for the romance, but it wasn’t that memorable. Still it was just okay.I tried to think of a way to review this book I tried and failed. How do you review something that left your heart thumping, your brow sweating, and your soul singing ? There are no words worthy of this feeling. I loved this book, I loved the world, the characters and even the villains. I hated the villains one completely, true unwavering hate for a certain father figure. It was so nice to have a completely evil force to focus on without those wavering good deeds mixed in. Do not judge this book by the cover or the blurb on the back, they are so off from the reality of what is on the pages. This is a WOW, high fantasy, mystery, action packed, romantic tale. The writing is so vivid so detailed I could read each page twice and pick up different things each time.I recommend this book and her Tairen Soul series already published -read them\"}, {'title': 'Hush, Hush #4Finale', 'author': 'Becca Fitzpatrick', 'summary': \"Nora and Patch thought their troubles were behind them.

There has been alot of hate going on for the series/books with all the \"hate review\" going on and I totally respect all or your opinions since there is something called \"freedom of speech\" and \"voicing your opinion\". I totally get that and I don\\'t have anything against you guys but some people are not just voicing there opinions, they\\'re straight out bashing the books and the author. There\\'s also one thing i do not understand, some people claim the books wasted their precious time and believe me time is very precious but yet they continue to waste there precious time to complain about the books, writing a hateful review on it, making a special list such as (random example) \"not even if my life was on the line\" and come on, like seriously don\\'t waste your time after you claim how precious it is, like seriously just get over it and let it go. :)If I have offended anyone in this I truly did not intend to do that I was just voicing MY own opinion!YES!!! There\\'s a Fourth book can\\'t believe it! I\\'m so happy that there\\'s a fourth book and sad at the same time. I\\'m happy because the Hush, Hush, series won\\'t end yet and I\\'m sad because I have to wait another WHOLE YEAR till the fourth book comes out, but I\\'m still EXTREMELY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!! =)UPDATEOMG THAT COVER IS GORGEOUS, I CAN\\'T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT!!! <3I simply loved this series. I will miss you Pat h!!!!!PEOPLE ..........GET A GRIP. YOU ARE COMPLAINING BECAUSE A PUBLISHING COMPANY IS PUBLISHING A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT THAT IS SELLING.AND BY THE WAY, HERE IS THE KICKER. Free Will. YOU have the choice to by it or not. If is sucks so bad to you, WHY do you buy the first 3 and read them ALL. Books I do not like, I stop reading and toss them, then GUESS WHAT....I do not by the next in the series. WOW, What a concept.The worst thing about another Hush Hush book is that we have to wait to read it. I love me some bad boy Patch!!DOBBY IS FREE!!This was theworst book in the series.I skimmed a lot of it because Nora Bitch couldn\\'t stop talking, thinking, or existing. She is such a hypocrite, I can\\'t anymore. Sour Patch deserves better than her. He is actually a really good character and boyfriend but he\\'s stuck with a bratty teen who needs to be slapped every five seconds.The whole Nephilim vs Fallen Angels thing went downhill. Such poor execution of a good build up. Dante was an interesting character, him and Sour Patch kept things bearable for me.This finale is a big disappointment and I wish it ended with the Bitch\\'s death but sadly we can\\'t have good things in life 🙃~•~•~If I can commit to a toxic series without caring about my sanity, imagine my commitment to a toxic man🤡🤡 SEND HELPPIt. Is. Over. I did it. I read the entire\\xa0Hush, Hush\\xa0series. And I came out alive. Just.Buckle up, kids. I am posting my final review and you had better believe there are going to be some serious spoilers.Silence, the third book in the series, left off with Nora Grey killing the Black Hand, Hank Millar. She has sworn a blood-oath to become the new leader of the Nephilim army and lead the race in a war against the fallen angels. It’s not that she wants to lead the army; she wants peace on earth and no more bloodshed for either race. But it’s a case of if she doesn’t lead the army, she and her mum will die.\\xa0Behold the morality of your new leader, Nephilim. Nora Grey doesn’t much care that fallen angels routinely\\xa0possess your bodies. It’s not\\xa0terribly\\xa0important to her that you are an enslaved race. She thinks slave and captor alike should just put down their weapons and love each other. However she’s chosen to “lead you”, to save her mum.So that’s how we begin the final leg of this story. Our bird-brained heroine Nora Grey, whose name perfectly illustrates her personality, has been made a fucking war general. And how does she deal with this? She goes clubbing.So she and BFF Vee are all up in da club when we are introduced to brand new character Dante: menacingly flirtatious Nephil, Nora’s self-appointed PR manager and essentially wants to be seen as the Clegg to her Cameron. After flirting with Nora for longer than is necessary, Dante tells her it would be a good idea to boost her media presence, show her under a positive light, give her new Nephilim army a reason to like her. Straight off the bat it should not be known that Nora is having secret facenoms with a fallen angel, so maybe she should pretend to be in a relationship with a nice Nephil boy, someone like Scott (remember him? Pointless secondary character who has\\xa0literally\\xa0contributed fuckall to the plot?)“Oh no,” says Nora, “he’s a friend! It would be too weird, and besides my BFF fancies the pants off the man. Suggest someone else, go on, I dare you.”“Me.” shrugs Dante.“Oh em gee!” says Nora, fanning herself with her hand, “I had no idea you were going to suggest yourself. I immediately accept.”We don’t have to wait long before Nora is abducted again. This time it’s by some\\xa0very scary\\xa0Nephilim who\\xa0throw a bag over her head\\xa0and drive her to an undisclosed location and – *gasp* –\\xa0shout at her for five minutes. Yes kids, it’s the final book now and the horrors of war are well and truly upon us.In an incredibly interesting turn of events, Nora Grey does not panic. She stays calm, sasses her kidnappers and without hesitation\\xa0attempts to beat the shit out of them. I kid you not, it actually happened. Behold, direct quote:“I met Cowboy Hat’s eyes coldly…then bucked my foot up with all the force I had and planted it squarely in his chest. He sailed backwards into the wall and crumpled on the floor.”Now I know this is entirely because Nora is full-blown Nephil now and she has heightened senses and more strength, but\\xa0hot-damn\\xa0it is still good to see her actually\\xa0do\\xa0something for a change! Sure, Patch shows up fairly quickly to rescue the poor broad, but Nora has\\xa0already fought her kidnappers and told ’em to jog on. Patch has nothing left to do except drive her home.Never thought I’d say this, but +1 to Nora Grey.The plot continues with Nora attempting to trick the world into thinking she and Patch have broken up and doing daily training with Dante. To make Nora stronger, Dante slips her a dose of devilcraft, which is a deliberately vague ethereal blue liquid (supposedly from hell) the magical properties of which enable you to do\\xa0whatever the hell you want\\xa0without having to explain how it works because plot. It also conveniently explains every single one of the convenient plot-holes in this entire book, and there are too many to even list. Ugh.And then miss Grey goes and gets herself in trouble yet again.Yet nothing goes as expected.An archangel called Pepper holds a gun to Nora. She remains calm and strong. She challenges him. Attempts to get information out of him. She makes use of her rusty, cobweb-covered brainbox in order to\\xa0think up a plan to get her out of this mess. AND SHE DOES.It was at this point that I had to stop and figure out what the hell had just happened. For three whole books, Nora Grey has been a nothing more than a puddle of existence. She is an established fainter, the kid of girl whose life revolves around her boyfriend, the kind of girl who\\xa0wipes her nose on Dante’s shirt and\\xa0actually\\xa0snivels about not being as strong as a natural-born Nephil. The girl can’t apply logic to even the most basic of scenarios. She fell in love with Patch\\xa0after\\xa0he admitted to having tried to\\xa0murder her! Nora Grey is a sad excuse for a heroine and it is completely out of character for her to be sassy, strong and crafty.It all went from utter confuzzlement to sudden enlightening clarity.Oh Becca Fitzpatrick…it all becomes clear. I see what you have done.In what was either a stunning display of her creative disability or just a massive\\xa0dick move, Fitzpatrick decided to completely and utterly change Nora Grey’s personality. No personal growth, no reflection of change, no puzzlement over the recent turn of events. Is it the fact that she’s now Nephilim? Could it be the devilcraft? Do any other characters even\\xa0acknowledge\\xa0her complete shift of being? BIG. FAT.\\xa0NOPE. Nora Grey is now the kind of girl who will stand up for herself without fear and not wait around for her man to rescue her…just…because.On top of it all, Nora has had a complete change of heart RE: the war. Now that she is Nephilim, Nora realizes that – oh shit! – a fallen angel can actually possess me! Well shit. I don’t want that to happen, I completely see your point of view now Nephilim, let us fight these sons of bitches and have ourselves some bloodshed!“You can’t constantly protect me, Patch. I appreciate the thought, but I’m Nephilim now. I’m immortal and less in need of our protection. I’m a target of fallen angels, archangels, and other Nephilim, and there’s nothing I can do about that. Except learn to fight back.”Let’s attempt to move on.Cheshvan (the month where possession is possible) is upon them and the fallen are primed to possess them all pretty much any day now. They’re still not strategizing. Nora Grey is the leader of the army, and\\xa0still\\xa0she makes no attempt to suss out what the hell they’re going to do. She throws a bitching Halloween party though, fallen angels attack them and everything. She fights them off (easily), and still isn’t inspired to do some war planning. She just heads off with Dante to some strength training instead…Where Dante informs her……the Nephil army has a secret facility where they keep captured fallen angels, weakened by devilcraft, so that Nephilim can learn to\\xa0possess the fallen angels.Just\\xa0what\\xa0is Nora Grey’s reaction to this shocking news?[paraphrasing]“Awesome. Show me how.”[/paraphrasing]Let. Me. Get. This. Straight. The whole point of this war…the whole\\xa0reason\\xa0Nora now wants to be part of it…is because possession is\\xa0wrong. On a scale of how badly you can violate a person, possession is up there with\\xa0rape.And Nora Grey doesn’t even hesitate to go ahead possess a fallen angel?!Leaving aside the glaring plot hole where it isn’t even possible for Nephilim to possess fallen angels (Fitzpatrick explains this by saying “devilcraft, because shut up”). Leaving aside the fact that the “facility” that Dante is referring to\\xa0is essentially a goddamn concentration camp. Leaving aside all that…Nora Grey, do you even realize the hypocrisy, the ignorance and the moral indecency of your actions??Why the hell am I even asking? It’s Nora\\xa0fucking\\xa0Grey.I don’t like this book.At this point I could not believe what I was reading. I actually had a word with a friend about it. At one point I actually begged him to convince me that it was a trick. Surely this would be the whole point of the novel, right? This is how I wanted it to end:Nora gets in over her head and ends up getting her whole Nephilim army to learn the art of possession, leading to a meaningless war of possession left right of centre, thus perfectly illustrating the absurdity of war and how in reality there aren’t always clear-cut good guys and bad guys; conflict is not black and white, folks! It would be an interesting reflection on our culture and history, which isn’t often seen in the YA genre. In the end, Patch or someone would show Nora the error of her ways and…peaceful conclusion or something?My friend politely reminded me exactly what book series I was reading, and that it was, in all likelihood, not going to end well.But I tried to convince myself. I really did. It was the\\xa0only way\\xa0to make it better. It simply\\xa0had\\xa0to be put right.So did it?After a scene where a beaten up, nameless prisoner fallen angel is possessed my Nora…it’s not mentioned again. At first, it felt like Fitzpatrick had just conveniently\\xa0forgotten\\xa0this whole plot line. Just like in a scene where poor Patch laments the fact the has no sense of touch and can’t feel Nora’s kisses, but on the next page touches her cheek and remarks that she feels cold (fuck sake). But no, Nora actually going ahead and possessing a fallen angel is never mentioned…until it serves as the crux of the entire series. She possesses Dante (bad guy all along, who would have guessed!) in order to kill him…and that somehow makes all the fallen angels except Patch die as well (devilcraft, because shut up).All is well. Nora and Patch get married and have endless facenoms. BFF Vee Sky is revealed to be Nephilim for absolutely no reason whatsoever and Scott dies. Such a shame, he was so ineffectual in this series, I shall miss him.That’s the series.And the moral of the story? Possession is inherently wrong, so the good guys give the evil-possessing guys a taste of their own medicine and possess them right back. And live happily ever after.Huh. I guess it does sum up how\\xa0fucking\\xa0terrible war is after all.This is where I leave you.I am completely, vehemently, DONE.I have reviewed the whole seriesHush, Hush (#1)|Crescendo (#2)|Silence (#3)|Finale (#4)Seriously, Fitzpatrick?!Seriously?!I just.....I just can\\'t understand! First Adornetto, then Kate, and now you not only once with your freaking graphic novel, buttwice?!See, you\\'re even makingDean(my dearest Mocha\\'s husband) cry. This madness has to end!All of the authors I\\'ve mentioned so far are not doing this to advance the story, in any way, shape, or form. Hell, all of these series could have been done in half the amount that there are currently; all of these authors are doing it for one reason only: the money. I understand that the life of an author is a hard one, but whatever happened to the damn story?!It just sad. Writing books should never be about just the money; it should be about making an impact on society, actually furthering your story arc, something, anything but swindling people out of their hard-earned cash on a book that really should never have been published. But that\\'s the world we live in today, isn\\'t it? Authors that actually have good, original, stories and put their heart and soul into their writing are turned down just because of today\\'s pop culture; those millions of little idiotic girls screaming for the next Edward and Bella. I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been more unhappy to see a book published than Twilight; honestly, it changed the whole dynamic for YA and that\\'s basically all we\\'ve gotten since then. Shit-tons of TSTL girls, overly protective-and in some ways downright abusive- guys, with plots as slow as molasses, horrible research skills, and characters/ story arcs that authors just add in or throw out for the hell of it.I\\'m sick. Sick and tired of it. This is what I feel like doing to all of those authors right about now:Oh, and some of this:Edit:So.....she\\'s calling this book asaga?!Sigh.....I don\\'t even have the energy to be mad about that, after my brutal smack-down, so, please, let me direct you all to my dearest friend Anila\\'s review that describes my pain over all of thisperfectly.'}, {'title': 'The War of Lost Hearts #1Daughter of No Worlds', 'author': 'Carissa Broadbent', 'summary': 'A former slave fighting for justice.

The writing was beautiful & so easy to follow along, character development was amazing, & storyline was so entertaining!!!! Max?! He was so pure I love him sm.okay. wow. this is soooo much better than i thought it would be. definitely a case of “dont judge a book by its cover” because the cheesy budget 2000s YA-esque cover doesnt even hint at how exciting this story is.the characters are interesting and have such compelling relationships/connections with each other, the plot is engaging and feels fast-paced even though the book itself is quite lengthy, and what surprised me the most was the writing! theres a certain depth to it that perfectly matches the tone of the story.overall, a very wonderful surprise of a book. excited to see where the series goes.↠4 stars✅ Gorgeous cover✅ Strong, resilient, and badass main character✅ Love interest✅ Action✅ Magic / Powers✅ Hate-to-love (kind of) / Slow burn and sweet romance✅ Funny moments✅ Pace and plot✅ Trainor-trainee trope✅ 2 POVs❗️❗️ Trigger warnings: slavery, torture and sex trade mentionedMy name is Tisaanah. I am a free woman and yet still a slave. I am fragments of many things but a whole of only myself. I am a daughter of no worlds, and all worlds.And I am not done yet.Why have I never heard about this book before last month? It was SO GOOD. You all need to read this series!!I admit that I first decided to read this book because of the cover (ok, the summary was intriguing too, but it\\'s mostly the cover that did it for me), but I honestly couldn’t put it down once I started it even though it is kinda long it is so compelling and addictive. The heroine is a kick-ass, strong, and resilient woman, she reminds me of Celaena inThrone of Glass, but she is less vain and has a more altruistic purpose (I’m not saying that Celaena was selfish, just that at first it was mostly about revenge and less about saving the world).“I was too young to know the truth then. That victory meant another’s defeat, and sometimes our own defeat. That winning meant sacrifices, and sometimes ones that even our own people were not willing to make. That in war, someone always paid.”Tisaanah is a slave that managed to earn the gold required to buy her freedom, but when the discussion with her master ends in blood and murder, she has to flee. She travels to Ara where she joins the Order, an organization of magic wielders. She wants to train to develop the magical power that she has had since she was a little girl, but only ever used for a performance purpose. She also wants to ask the order for help and resources so she can go back to Threll and free all the other slaves that she left behind.The man tasked with her training is Max, an ex-soldier and a wielder with a dark past who wants nothing to do with the Order anymore. He is grumpy, antisocial, and sarcastic, and I love him. My poor heart bled for him when we learned more details about his dark past and I really hope that he can find love and peace in the future. He is kind and sweet under his gruffiness and I want more of him.I wanted him in so many ways. As a friend, as a kindred soul, as a fierce teammate. As skin and lips and teeth. As a hitched breathless moan in the darkness or a lazy embrace in the sunrise. I wanted that. I wanted it all.The development of the relationship between Tisaanah and him and the budding romance is not a surprise at all, but I still enjoyed reading about their interactions SO MUCH. How they slowly figured out that the other also had many mental and physical scars, and that maybe they could help each other to heal, or at least to feel less alone... It was perfectly done. ❤️My Aran improved dramatically. Still, every so often, I would unleash a string of truly nonsensical words that butchered every conceivable rule of grammar. On one particularly exhausting day, I committed one such crime when asking Max where the Stratagram ink had gone. (“Has gone where… black water?”)Max hadn’t so much as paused as he reached into a drawer and produced the ink. At Sammerin’s look of somewhat horrified amazement, he shrugged and said, “After a while, you become fluent in Tisaanah-speak.” And we looked at each other and exchanged a small, proud smile.The fact that Tisaanah couldn’t speak Max’s language very well at first also created some funny and lighter moments that counterbalanced the more serious tone of their discussions.I had spent the night cutting myself up into little pieces for consumption, forcing people to acknowledge me, thrusting my pain into their faces.I really like Tisaanah, she is so determined, driven, and strong, she lets nothing get in her way, and even though she was a slave for many years and was mistreated and abused in many ways, she always finds a way to remain focused and to adapt to the situation she is in. She does not let anger blind her and make her lose sight of her goal.“This is not a game, Zeryth,” I said. “I have twenty-seven scars on my back from the night I tried to buy my freedom and Esmaris rewarded me by trying to beat me to death. I was beaten, I was raped, I was almost killed. It is written into my body and soul, just as your guilt in it is written into yours, whether you want to see it or not. But you cannot ignore it. Neither can I. And neither can they, because I will not allow them to.”“I have to say, Tisaanah, it was worth it to brave my first Order event in the better part of a decade just to see the looks on their faces when you were done with them.”“I’m not done with them. I have barely begun.”Tisaanah’s attitude towards Zeryth and the other members of the order who look down on her is awesome. I wanted to cackle like an old witch when I read how she put everyone back in their spot with a nice smile and a kind of sarcastic comment. How she managed to remain so calm and level-headed and to keep her anger at bay for so long is a mystery to me. She is so driven and strong and she knows how to play the game, she is also willing to sacrifice parts of herself, but not to compromise, which makes her a force of nature. I am in admiration of her. I think I might even be in love. She is an AMAZING main character.I am really eager to know what will happen to the two main characters next, and I am also very curious to discover who is against them and who wants to use them, and for what purpose. It is made clear in the last part of the book that someone is using them, but I am not sure yet how many people are involved in this deception and what are the motives of the “bad guy”.“Never look back. And never question stepping forward and saying, ‘I deserve to live.’”0.5Ashen Son⭐⭐⭐Follow me on Instagram🙂I was absolutely amazed by experiencing this book as anaudiobook. The narration brought the story to life in a way that felt incredibly immersive, drawing me deeper into the world of the protagonist and her extraordinary journey.From the moment I started listening (Daughter of No Worlds), I was entranced by the unique world-building and intricate characters that author has crafted. The story follows a remarkable protagonist, navigating a universe where love is a dangerous force and heartbreak is a weapon.The depth of emotion in this book is truly remarkable. I felt a genuine connection to the protagonist as she grappled with her identity and the secrets of her past. The themes of love, loss, and resilience resonated deeply with me, making this more than just a fantastical adventure.One of the standout elements of this book is the richly imagined universe filled with magical beings and political intrigue. Author descriptive prose brought each setting to life, immersing me in a world where nothing is as it seems and alliances are fragile.As I followed the protagonist\\'s journey, I found myself eagerly turning pages, desperate to uncover the mysteries that surrounded her and the fate of the worlds at stake. The plot twists kept me on my toes, and the ending left me hungry for more.BEYOND FIVE STARS!!!!SPOILERS: SERIOUSLY, IF YOU HAVEN\\'T READ THIS BOOK, TURN BACK RIGHT NOW!!LAST WARNINGThis book broke me, ruined me. I am fucking dead. Dead Dead Dead Dead.SO my ghost is now writing this by making chopsticks float in the air and having them press on the keyboard. So first I want to thank everyone who recommended this book to me. Fuck you, I hope you die a slow terrible death and choke on the vomit, which is the vomit of the vomit you just recently ate.I also want to thank @Rachel Rowell for being the one to recommend this book first. If you are seeing this review, I want you to know that I have your address bitch, and I am coming to hunt you down for bringing me the pain and torture that is this book. That\\'s right, you better piss your pants, bc I\\'m about to go all ghetto on your ass.Now that I\\'m done threatening the people that have shattered my heart, this book was gold. The cover was gold, the blurb was gold, the writing was gold, the characters were gold. No, everything was fucking diamond.I loved Tisaanah she was a bad bitch who probably would scam old people of their money just for fun. she doesn\\'t do that in the book but this is 100% headcannon. Also, I loved that Broadbent actually had time to make a foreign mc who doesn\\'t speak the other characters\\' language, I appreciated that so fucking much, because it warmed my heart how Tisaanah became accustomed to other cultures without forgetting her own.She is headstrong, stubborn, but at the same time, she isn\\'t an asshole for no complete reason. She\\'s kind and compassionate. And when she accepted Reshaye, it was so hard seeing that thing hurt and possess her. She was so fucking passionate and powerful, you could see how she fought for her will. Seriously, Broadbent does not hesitate to traumatize these characters, and she\\'s probably sipping some pink drink from Starbucks while casually writing their torture scenes. Like, I\\'d do the same thing to my characters because TRAUMA = SPICE. But seriously, Tisaanah is the most beautiful character I\\'ve ever seen.And Max, oh how I love Max, he is a teddy bear. He gives me Matthias HElvar mixed with Aaron Warner vibes and I fucking love it. The things he has been through made him such a strong character. Also, from the minute I saw him making a garden, I\\'d knew he was my soulmate, unlike some basic gardening bitches *cough*Elain*cough*. Annnyway. I loved the way he warmed up to Tisaanah. They began to open up to each other, and honestly, they knew one another more than they knew themselves.Also the way he sees her scars and\\'s like in a brooding voice \"i hope whoever did that you suffered long and hard, and i wish I could be the one to do that to them\".AAAAIFNJIFINCNA, my MILLION DOLLAR 😺 IS THROBBING IN MY DENIM TIGHT ANNOYINGASFUCK CAMELTOE JEANS. just kidding y\\'all I\\'m wearing pants.Anyway, the worldbuilding was also fucking gold. It was amazing stupendous (omg I spelled stupendous right without using autocorrect, maybe I\\'m not a bimbo)wonderful, out-of-this-world(pun intended, I should be a comedian), beautiful, gold, brownie-point earning........*twelve hours later*spectacular, mind-blowing, galaxy-like...anyway. Yes, the plot was amazing. Basically, Tisaanah kills her slaver (like the boss bitch that she is 😜) and escapes to join the Orders, which basically take these wizard people called wielders and makes them soldiers. and our golden retriever girl has to train with our brooding bear. But The Orders isn\\'t as it seems.Basically, they are murderers, and have murdered innocent people for \"the greater good\", so basically the fantasy version of the natzis, and they are harbinging this magic thing called Reshaye, and when Tisaanah takes her test to become a true wielder in the Order, she also passes the test to harbor Reshaye.Now i fucking hated reshaye at first, but damn, Broadbent knows how to make you feel for characters. Reshaye isn\\'t even a person, and I just wanted it to be happy, although it was mind-torturing Tisaanah left and right. Isolation can do a lot to a person, or a not-person-but-kind-of-person. And Reshaye was just afraid of being left alone., but at the same time, it was so hard seeing Tisaanah endure the torture from this creature-person. Max was her anchor to reality, and she stayed strong for him. It was so beautiful seeing them fight for each other on both sides.GOD DAMN IT, BROADBENT, YOU\\'RE BREAKING MY HEART.And the writing. The fucking writing. Just beautiful. It was so painful and melodic, and music-but-really-ink-but-still-music to my ears. just so well written, you could feel what Max and Tisaanah felt.Also, Moth is a cutie.MAX CAN GARDEN ME ANYTIME!!!!🥵---------------my heart is utterly ruined. I am numb. I no longer feel.Review to come-------------------currently reading!!I\\'m 4/5\\'s through and my heart is already crumbling. Either author\\'s are heartless sadists or they get paid to make readers suffer!!'}, {'title': 'Stepbrother Dearest', 'author': 'Penelope Ward', 'summary': 'You’re not supposed to want the one who torments you. When my stepbrother, Elec, came to live with us my senior year, I wasn’t prepared for how much of a jerk he’d be. I hated that he took it out on me because he didn’t want to be here. I hated that he brought girls from our high school back to his room. But what I hated the most was the unwanted way my body reacted to him. At first, I thought all he had going for him were his rock-hard tattooed abs and chiseled face. Then, things started changing between us, and it all came to a head one night. Just as quickly as he’d come into my life, he was gone back to California. It had been years since I’d seen Elec. When tragedy struck our family, I’d have to face him again. And holy hell, the teenager who made me crazy was now a man that drove me insane.I had a feeling my heart was about to get broken again.Stepbrother Dearest is a standalone novel.', 'rating': '4.03', 'reviews': 'So...Where to start?I am always intrigued with books dealing with taboo topics (or in this case pseudo-taboo), especially incestuous relationships. At first I crossed this book from my TBR shelf because it seemed like a trashy romance. But then all this five stars reviews started popping out all over the Goodreads. So, I gave in to the temptation. And once again, I should have stick to the original plan.The story.The horror! My eyes!!! What is this shit???But seriously, if you are getting off on forbidden sexual relationships, readSelena Kitt. At least you know what you are about to get when you pick up her novels -Naughty Bitsis a hard core brother/sister erotica. For those who are a bit squeamish, there is even a bit tamer version of the same story -Yank.Back toStepbrother Dearest. The only selling point of this book is forbidden romance. I believe that it was what appealed to the most of the girls who were all moon eyed after finishing this book.Story is divided in two parts - first is about how they met when they were 17 and second is taking place seven years later.What happens?They meet, they lust, they fight, they hang out, they fight, play video games, go out on double date, fight, lust,kiss, he treats like she is worthless, she cries, they lust again, fight again, and - epic finale, they fuck. He is whore, she is virgin. She is \"clean\" like flower in pretty meadow, and all other girls are worthless sluts.She is idiot who lets him treat her like a trash.He is a jerk/bad boy/lost soul/little boy in hot, pierced, tattooed body.Whole book is series of their \"forbidden encounters\" and fighting against what they feel.No character development. No. Plot. Development.How was this written?Oh look, girls like to read about bad boys, let\\'s put that in. What does it mean to be a bad boy? A lot of tattoos, pierced lip, pierced dick, he should be moody and grunt a lot. He is so hot that all girls throw themselves at him - so he fucks a lot. But, he needs to have some signature move - he can\\'t fuck like a regular person. He has to be a bit rough and crude. Oh, I know - let him have fixation with necks. Like, biting them. Or maybe even strangling them lightly. Yeah, that would work. But he is not actually bad. He has daddy issues. Mommy is crazy like a bat. He is really a little boy who wants to be loved.But that is not enough. We need more drama. Because girls love drama! Oh, I know! Spanish soap operas, thank you for this brilliant idea.\"I am my brother\\'s bastard son.\"Yes, that would be so awesome. His parents were in forbidden relationship. Just like he wants to be with his stepsister. Ugh, wait... No just like that. His brother is not his father. Their father is their father. His brother is his stepfather. But his mommy never loved his father. He was... But his brother hates him. He verbally abuses him. His mother is depressed. She is artist. He is wannabe writer. He is not a bad boy. He just looks like one. Because he has daddy/brother/mommy issues.Now what about girl? Of course she has to virgin, because she is a good girl. But she is not naive - she has vibrator. She is super polite and good. And she constantly repeats how her stepbrother is hot and imagines hundred dirty things she would like to do to him. He treats her like she\\'s worthless, but that won\\'t make her give up on him because she sees how vulnerable and good underneath he is. How? Meh.. that doesn\\'t matter - only important thing are her nipples. Yes, she should have sensitive nipples.The most important thing - a lot of make out and almost make out scenes.Oh, and in the part 2 there will me everything from the part 1 told from his point of view. Word for word, in case people missed anything. So they can read it. All over again.I will repeat - if you are getting off on this kind of thing - read Selena Kitt.I\\'m out!★★★★ ½! Stepbrother Dearest (stand-alone). Tragedy re-connects girl with the step-brother she still loves, but can’t have! Stepbrother Dearest = Heart Be Desert Ports!“I want to be the first one to show you everything and to be the one you’ll always remember for the rest of your life.”Stepbrother Dearest(stand-alone) opens up to high school seniorGreta Hansenwaiting for her stepbrother to arrive for a year-long stay. Nothing could have prepared her forElec O’Rourke. He is eerily handsome borderline beautiful, but he is also angry, broken, cocky and oh so determined not to like her.Greta is smitten, but in all her innocence doesn’t quite know how to deal with him.The sexual tension is off-the-charts…Soon Greta starts gettingmixed signals from Elec.He taunts herwith his sexuality and his many girlfriends only to do or say something kind and then back to being hostile. In weak moments there arestolen kissesandsexually charged conversationswith Greta hoping for more…Then Elec has to leave abruptly…But not beforestealing Greta’s heartandaccepting her innocence. Some truths are revealed but for most parts Elec remains an enigma.Fast forward seven long years…In many waysGreta’s life stopped that fateful day. Sure she went onto College, graduated, moved to New York and got a clerical job. She even had a brief engagement. But her heart never got over Elec.She has cocooned herself in a mundane existence.Whentragedy brings them together it’s a shock for both. Everything has changed yet somehow it\\'s just the way they left off. They still have thisintense, undeniable pull towards each other with too much standing in their way. Elec remains elusive sending Greta mixed signals.Much of story is themnavigating after tragedy, spending time catching up and slowlyopening upabout their current and past situations. It’s a slow, painful process of uncoveringheartaches; unimaginablesecretsandpains. It’s also aboutcould-have-beens,regretsandhopelessness. Ultimately it’s their story of ansoul searching passionandunending loveand how in life sometimes everything still isn’t enough….“You were the best thing that ever happened to me. I hope someday I can say you were one of the best, but for now, it’s only you.”Eight words to describeElec O’Rourke: Captivating, broken, cocky, vulnerable, torn, observant, complex and secretive.“Holy hell… his tip was pierced. What a way to be introduced to my first live one.”Seven words to describeGreta Hansen: Sweet, timid, unassuming, loyal, innocent, endearing and naive.“Physically, he was my dream and in every other way, my nightmare.”Stepbrother Dearestis abeautifully told tale, a roller-coaster of events and emotions. At times painful to read. There are a couple of reason for book title with which will be revealed by the ending! My favorite was the first part and the young Elec. Overall I enjoyed their journey, but mostI loved where it left them!The perfect ending = Rec Penned Gift!Excellentstory-telling!Angstyandengagingplot!Swoon-worthyhero!Just like Elec kept a piece of Greta’s heart, he kept part of mine.“He kept his hand on my throat and lightly squeezed it.

I was hooked on this book from the moment I started it and I could not put it down until the end!! An angsty, unconventional love story and such a roller coaster! It was absolutely unputdownable.When Greta\\'s stepbrother came to live with them during her senior year, she never expected him to be such a jerk, and she certainly never expected to feel so drawn to him. He was stunning. Gorgeous. Hot. Tattooed and pierced (yes, there!!) with bad habits and a bad attitude to match. And yet she sensed something behind his abrasive behaviour... something that showed her a vulnerability and hurt that she could see was eating away at him, and she was determined to get through to him one way or another.He was rude, he lashed out with his words, paraded girls in front of her, and toyed with her emotions... and yet the next moment he was putting himself in harms way to protect her. One thing was certain: there was more to Elec than met the eye.Once they got past their initial differences, he made it still clear that there were some lines he would not cross. And once she got to know him it became clear that underneath all the anger that he showed the world was a guy with a very good heart who wanted her just as much as she wanted him.\"You\\'re the only girl in the entire world that\\'s forbidden, and fuck me if that doesn\\'t make me want you more than anything.\"But just when things were looking up, one night and one phone call changed everything. Forever. And just as quickly as he entered her life, he was gone again. And she didn\\'t see him again for seven years.When a family tragedy brought them both back home, they were both shocked to see how some things (heartbreaking things) had changed so much and others hadn\\'t changed even one bit.This is a sexy, angst-filled story of first love and forbidden desires. It\\'s a story with imperfect people who sometimes choose wrong. It\\'s a story with heart break and angst, but also with healing and growth. And most of all it\\'s a story of learning to follow your heart. Sometimes, you just have to listen to your heart.\"I want to be the only one to show you everything and to be the one you\\'ll always remember for the rest of your life.\"Oh my gosh, their reunion just punched me in the gut. Again. And again. And again. That little twist. My poor heart was just shredded. But at the same time, I understood what had happened. It made sense given the timeline... but it didn\\'t make it one but easier to read.\"I know I\\'m not supposed to care. But when it comes to you, what I\\'m supposed to be feeling has never seemed to matter.\"There are no good stopping points in this book and it keeps you desperate to find out what happens next. But especially from about 54% on til the end, I\\'m pretty sure I didn\\'t move once from my spot on the couch and just sat there madly flipping pages and devouring the story.\"I\\'m... fighting the urge to back you up against this wall and fuck you so hard that I\\'ll have to carry you back to your room.\"This is the kind of book where, once you start reading, you\\'ll want to cancel all your plans for the rest of the day so that you can just keep reading it. I loved the way the author incorporated both sides of the story. It was a very unique way to show the dual POV and I thought it really worked well for this. There was so much that I loved about the story but it also wasn\\'t perfect for me. There were some things (in the second half) that I might have wanted a little differently but they didn\\'t stop me from loving the story and there\\'s really no doubt that this book was completely unputdownable!!If you want a sexy, unique, unconventional romance to fall in love with, try this one!!Rating: 4.5 stars. Standalone New Adult Romance._______________________________________For more of my reviews, book news and updates:✦Main blog: Aestas Book Blog✦Facebook Blog Page✦Twitter3.5 StarsI’m not going to lie… the title and the cover of this book drew me right in and made me one click the minute it went live. I’ve never read this author and I wasn’t sure what the book was about (besides a stepbrother/stepsister) but I knew I had to read it. I LOVE forbidden love stories so the title alone drew me in.Stepbrother Dearestwas different that I expected. It was a little ‘young’ for a lack of a better word, at the beginning. Then it got a little sweet and sexy. The last half was much more angsty. It was one of those books that wasn’t perfect for me, but it was also one that I read in one sitting so you know I was hooked from the start.Greta’s stepbrother Elec is 17, just like her. She’s never met him, but he’s coming to stay with her family for a year while his mom travels from work. Greta wants to get to know Elec, to make him feel comfortable. Once she sees him, she is floored. He might be the most attractive guy she\\'s met… but he’s also a jerk to her.Elec has a bad relationship with his father. He does not want to be living in that house, but doesn’t have much of a choice. Elec makes it his mission to give Greta a hard time. The harder he pushes, the more she tries to befriend him and get to know him. Slowly, she works her way in.Elec and Greta have a unique relationship when they are teenagers. They’re only together a short time, but they start to become friends. As their friendship progresses, they find it hard to deny their obvious attraction to one another. Though they are together months, one night is all they really get together. One night of memories.“I’d rather have one night with you than nothing at all.”“Just know that I would stay with you if I could.”Elec can’t stay. He has other family issues that keep him away. And he stays away. For seven years. Seven years later, Greta is living in NYC. After a failed engagement, she is single and working. She’s content with her life. Then she gets a call from her mother that will change everything. It’s the call that brings Elec back into her life.The ‘one that got away’ was supposed to stay away, not come back and leave you all over again.Oh the emotions when Elec was back. I didn’t know what to feel. I know as I read and the more I learned of their situation, I bit my nails right to the quick. My heart was slowly breaking. The angst about killed me. No matter whats going on in their lives, Elec and Greta can’t deny the feelings they still have for one another.“I know I’m not supposed to care. But when it comes to you, what I’m supposed to be feeling has never seemed to matter.”When reading a book, there are certain lines that just pop out at you. When I read this one, it brought me to tears.There was a lot that I liked about this book. I liked both Elec and Greta. Both had moments where I wanted to shake them, but by the end of the book, I loved them both. I loved how the book ended. The beginning banter between Elec and Greta was great. There was a lot in the middle that stressed me out, but when I’m reading, I love when I get invested and feel like that, so it worked for me.The main thing I can think of that would have made this book so much better for me is the last 30% or so from Elec’s perspective. Don’t get me wrong- I loved being in his head and I think it was really important to get his side of the story, but to basically re-tell from his perspective that late in the book was a miss for me. I wish that it would have been in dual pov and woven in that way. I understand why the author did it this wayI’m sure it was because it he was following his dream as a writer and it was a big gesture to let her read his work and show his past and feelings that way, it just didn’t quite work for me.Overall, I did enjoy this one a lot. It was a forbidden love story, but not in the way you would think. The fact that the two were step siblings wasn’t a huge forbidden issue, it was something else. If you’re looking for an angst-filled read with a decent amount of steam, some romance and a jerky and damaged book boyfriend who has a good heart, pick this one up!To tell you the truth, I was not going to write a review for this book, because I really don’t have anything positive to say about it. There are many things that are wrong with this book, but I’ll just address two.First would bethe writing. It wasjuvenile! Especially in the first part. The plot was repetitive: they flirt, they fight, he insults her, she runs to him like a love-struck puppy. This book was trite, cliché and juvenile. Did I already say that? Ah, I don’t care, because this book obviously doesn’t have a problem with repeating itself. What was that with Elec’s book? Repeatingexactly the same eventsfrom his POV is so not cool. Dear author, that’s just plain cheating.Overall, Stepbrother Dearest is a poorly written novel, IMO.Second issue would be the main female protagonist –Greta.The best thing Elec said to Greta in this entire novel is:Have some self-respect!AMEN. Why didn’t you take that advice, told him to go screw himself and grow some big girl pants?It really made me sad, the way she let him continually disrespect her. And I’m not even talking about the first part when they were teenagers. That was child’s play. I know how when you’re in love, you’re willing to forgive almost anything, but this. Here. Is. Not. Okay. This novel is not a true, healthy representative of what a normal relationship should be like. I mean, in the first part I was willing to forgive her, she’s young and in love. But then came that part7 years afterand I was waiting to see the strong, independent woman she’s become. But, apparently she doesn’t exist. She’s still pinning after that jerk and lets him walk all over her.Also, all these five-star reviews are pissing me off. I’ve scrolled though some of them and people who disliked the book gave it 3 stars. Wut? Folks, it’s okay to give 1 or 2 star ratings from time to time. It’s making me sad that some really amazing books are not getting enough attention while crap like this gets a lot of undeserved hype.So, to conclude, I didn’t like it and don’t recommend it to anyone.Over and out.'}, {'title': 'Charley Davidson #1First Grave on the Right', 'author': 'Darynda Jones', 'summary': 'This whole grim reaper thing should have come with a manual.Or a diagram of some kind.A flow chart would have been nice.Charley Davidson is a part-time private investigator and full-time grim reaper. Meaning, she sees dead people. Really. And it\\'s her job to convince them to \"go into the light.\" But when these very dead people have died under less than ideal circumstances (like murder), sometimes they want Charley to bring the bad guys to justice. Complicating matters are the intensely hot dreams she\\'s been having about an entity who has been following her all her life...and it turns out he might not be dead after all. In fact, he might be something else entirely. But what does he want with Charley? And why can\\'t she seem to resist him? And what does she have to lose by giving in?With scorching-hot tension and high-octane humor, First Grave on the Right is your signpost to paranormal suspense of the highest order.', 'rating': '4.03', 'reviews': 'Charley Davidson is like white chocolate. You either love it, or you think it\\'s an abomination of nature.I love white chocolate, I love Charley Davidson, and I am not ashamed.She\\'s got such a great narrative voice - she is, dare I say it, a lot like me. A lot of deadpan humor. A lot of inappropriate thoughts at the worst possible times.“Well, I was kind of kidnapped, though not really kidnapped so much as led away.”A hand shot to her mouth to squelch a gasp.“God, all this sounds so awful when I say it out loud,” I complained. “I whine more than a Goth with a blogging fetish. It’s really not that bad. I actually grew up rather happy. I had lots of friends. They were mostly dead, but still.”Charley is special without being a special snowflake.“Is anything broken?” Uncle Bob’s voice had softened.“My eyelids, I think. I can’t open them.”I heard a soft chuckle. “If it were anyone else, I’d say eyelids can’t be broken. But considering the source…”A weak grin spread across my face. “So I’m, like, special?”He snorted as he pressed gingerly here and there, testing for broken bones and the like. “Special wouldn’t even begin to cover it, my dear.”Charley is a Grim Reaper. She can see the dead and take them through the other side. As you can well imagine, it must have been pretty fucking rough growing up with that ability. Seriously, some kid comes up to me and tells me\"I see dead people,\"you\\'d tell him he was nuts and eventually everyone else would pick up on the weirdness, because kids are assholes. Charley grew up ostracized by friends and even family, but she coped in her own way; she is strong, she is resilient. She isn\\'t filled with misery and depression and self-pity. She is pissed off, at times, but she deals with it through her snark and sarcasm and all-around awesome Charley-ness. Which isn\\'t to say she never gets angry, she damned well gets mad, but she can deal with the unfairness life has dealt her.“People like those assholes at the station yesterday. People like Taft with their sideways glances and hushed whispers who turn their backs on me every time I walk into a room. People like you who treat me like shit until they figure out I really can do what I say I can do. And then suddenly I’m their best friend.”We all have our coping mechanism, and I see her sarcasm and her inappropriate sense of humor as one of such. Seriously, I find Charley absolutely hilarious. She speaks her lines with such a deadpan sense of humor. The first time I read the book, I was howling with laughter.I twisted around in my seat to face him. “My fore-parts, as you so ineloquently put it, have names.” I pointed to my right breast. “This is Danger.” Then my left. “And this is Will Robinson. I would appreciate it if you addressed them accordingly.”After a long pause in which he took the time to blink several times, he asked, “You named your breasts?”I turned my back to him with a shrug. “I named my ovaries, too, but they don’t get out as much.I know that Charley isn\\'t everyone\\'s cup of tea, and I completely understand if she grates on your nerves, but personally, I adore her. (well, I can\\'t say the same for the later books in the series, but still)I think it\\'s time someone let the author of this book into a little secret: Ms. Jones, stringing together a thousand-odd wisecracks does not make a novel.Thatis more commonly known as a Joke Book. In fiction, we like our wisecracks accompanied by an actual plot, plot development, sub-plots and character development. Say it with me, Sto-ry-line.You know that teen movie trope about a nerdy guy trying to be popular by joking around with the jocks? Only his jokes always sound rehearsed and fall flat, and he fades away into obscurity?First Grave on the Right reminds me of nothing so much as that guy, trying desperately to be funny so people would be inclined to like him better and overlook his general lack of charisma. The book is filled with \\'gems\\' likeIsn’t that a bit like the pot calling the kettle African-American?andIf I were edible, I’d be a fruitcake.... no,of courseI haven\\'t heard that one before, ha ha.The only reason this book is getting two stars is because it actually managed to surprise some involuntary laughter out of me at some points. Here, for example:[...] On the plus side, I did learn that Martians should never try to become human just to drink our water. Since Martians didn’t exist, I figured they were part of some bizarre Rocket Man analogy. So what on Earth could be comparable to alien beings? Besides circus performers? It had to be someone living contrary to the norm. I could think of a couple of groups, but I felt strangely secure in the knowledge that Reyes was neither an IRS auditor nor a member of the Manson family.But such truly witty moments are few and far. The rest of the book reads like one of those sitcoms where the only laughter generated is from a can. You never really get a feel for any of the characters sandwiched in between all the sarcasm. Even Charley Davidson end up being an amalgamation of unending snark, constant injury and metaphysical sexcapades. She’s so busy inserting self-deprecating humor into her backstory she fails to make an impact even at the points when sheshouldhave been hitting the emotional hot buttons. And do NOT get me started on the number of times she tells Garrett Swopes to kiss her ass! Seriously, I think he got it the first ten times you said it, Charley!The plot development is rudimentary, at best. Characters appear, and disappear without warning, and their absences are never explained satisfactorily. The book begins when Charley encounters the ghosts of three law firm partners in quick succession, all three lawyers having been killed by the same modus operandi, at the same time. So, of course, one would be justified in thinking that this mystery would form the crux of the ‘plot’. One would be wrong. About a quarter of the way through, Charley, in a classic display of self-diagnosed ADD, suddenly decides to abandon this mystery in favour of hunting down her mysterious dream lover.The lawyer-mystery involves mafiosi, human trafficking, murder, false imprisonment and missing teenagers. But of course, solving that is a piece of cake. It requires about fifty pages in the beginning, a little five-page teaser in the middle, and a convenient ten-page conclusion with next to no investigative input from Charley Davidson, PI.All of the grim reaper-slash-private investigator’s resources, through most of the book, are tied up in investigating the mystery man who has hot dream sex with her every night. Said dreamboat (ha! Pun!) is, of course, supernatural, super-hot, super-powerful, super-possessive, super-protective and consequently,justthe sort of man every independent woman dreams of. Having started off their association on an auspicious note by strangling her in a chokehold and threatening to rape her, he then continues their happy, fulfilling relationship by vanishing for several decades before returning to dream-rape her anonymously. But hey, guess what, it’s all forgiven because he’s so hot and he’s saved her life several times, and the dream sex is so orgasmic, and she felt a ‘connection’ with him when he first assaulted and threatened her, and — did I mention — he’s SO HOT?!!Then there is the third angle in this painful triangle, the hot, human Garrett Swopes who pisses off our heroine by refusing to accept immediately that she can see ghosts. How very unreasonable and unromantic of him! No doubt, if he had pushed her up against the wall and threatened to whip her, she would have been more accepting of his measly human scruples! There are several heavy-handed hints that he likes Charley, but she remains madly in love with the man of her dreams. Who is in prison for murdering a man, but surprise, surprise, Charley justknowshe didn’t do it! Why? Becauseshedoesn’t believe he’s that kind of guy! I wonder why the defense didn’t present THAT argument during his trial?!There are several sub-plots that are very unnecessary, like the one about the client who tries to escape her abusive husband; ideally, this book would have worked way better if Jones had stuck to the Reyes storyline, eliminated the weak attempt at a stand-alone mystery, cut down on the canned sarcasm, and given her characters a personality. I cannot understand how Reyes could possibly be appealing? For almost all of the book, he is a dream-invading sex maniac who generally appears as a black blob and never says anything, and conveniently plays knight-in-black-cloud to Charley’s damsel in distress. Severing spines... the new route to winning hearts and seducing ladies!And the grand reveal at the end? SO unnecessary! The one thing this book had going for it was the fact that it was a fun, light-hearted read. To destroy that by introducing a grand battle between Heaven and Hell is just plain sad. Not to mention clichéd, and completely out of keeping with the irreverent tone of the rest of this book.All-in-all, a very forgettable book; I guess I would recommend it for a beach read, or for a very boring flight.You know, I love a well-written, well-constructed, complex urban fantasy world as much as anyone. I love beautiful writing, jam-packed plots and wild twists that I never would have seen coming. But sometimes, just sometimes, I have a real need for something lighthearted, nonsensical, silly and sexy. Like the Bridget Jones version of urban fantasy. Paranormal \"chick lit\" one might say.First Grave on the Rightis a girls\\' night in watching your all time favourite romcom whilst eating ice cream. In your pajamas. It\\'s pure, cookie dough-flavoured fun. It won\\'t change your life. It won\\'t introduce you to a new way of thinking. But, if you\\'re anything like me, it might just hijack your mind and take it to happy land for a while. Here\\'s what this book has: a sarcastic, witty and hilarious heroine; a sexy, mysterious guy; a murder mystery; and humour bursting from every page.Oh, what the hell, why use words when I can say it with gifs. And seeing as I\\'m currently re-watching Buffy and it seems appropriate, I\\'m going to say it with Buffy gifs.There\\'s some:And a touch of:And a whole lot of:And a bit more:(Note to readers: you might want to turn your google filters on before searching \"sexy gifs\". Unless, of course, you don\\'t.)I likedFirst Grave on the Rightso much that I bought the rest of the series all at once (something I just don\\'t normally do). I can see this being the kind of series that I\\'ll need a regular fix of because it\\'s delightfully addictive. I\\'m now getting started onSecond Grave on the Leftand I can\\'t wait to see more of Charley\\'s sarcasm, Reyes\\' sexiness, and the general demonic craziness going on.*sigh* This was just what I needed.First my over all impression of this book. Then I\\'ll give some detail as to why I feel as I do. I picked this up because it got a....\"whole passel\", of 4 and 5 star ratings here. My over all impression of the book????It\\'s crap.Why do I think that? Well at first I was thinking it would be okay if not one I really liked. It opened with an account of the protagonists dream where she was having intercourse with a \"hot\" shadowy figure. She made sure to tell us she\\'d had an orgasm.I sighed and went on. I can live with a little overt sex in a book if the author seems to think that it\\'s important to the story. I can usually skim through it if it gets really graphic. And if it\\'s really for the story you won\\'t be getting a heavy or graphic sex scene every second page. This was more, \"in your face\" than graphic. It was a short intro passage and I figured it was to tell me what a \"kick ass\" female protagonist we had.Except that about every second page our female P.I./Grim reaper had to refer back to her hot dream. She had to be sure and tell me/us that she\\'d never had an orgasm in a dream before. She had to tell us about her shadowy lover\\'s body parts etc.I sighed and moved past a lot.There is a bit of humor here but I didn\\'t find the character as funny as some did...or as funny as she finds herself.Sadly, for me anyway, I did see the beginnings of an interesting story here, but the writer just couldn\\'t or wouldn\\'t stay with it. She kept swerving off to one side. The wise cracking heroine\\'s story would draw me in and then crash.I can see that I might enjoy some things by this writer, but maybe I\\'m not the audience she\\'s shooting for. Many love this book, their reviews and ratings are why I tried it (though my first look at the cover art when I picked this up at the library signaled me I might be barking up the wrong proverbial tree). I held on following the story and the side trails we were running down (at the point where I was in the book, I have no idea how many of the dead people we\\'ve encountered would have ended up being part of the main plot). BUT we came to a scene where I realized we\\'d gone a bridge too far for me. (I\\'ll say below under a spoiler marker). I knew I didn\\'t even want to follow the story any more it seems there is a device she\\'s using (and of course some will disagree with me) that was something I didn\\'t care for.So, 1 star because I can\\'t go lower and I didn\\'t finish the book...Now, what pushed me over the edge?As I said our heroine goes on at length about her \"sex\" life. Up to a point I was philosophical about it. I could take the commentary on men\\'s butts and so on. Some feel that\\'s just the female half of the population getting their own back a bit.But we came to a scene where we saw what was described as a \"boy\" being assaulted, possibly attempted murder....our protagonist intervenes (of course). Not to give the whole scene , but when she interacts with the \"boy\" he seems bigger. He wants her to stay out of it. He threatens her, he grabs her throat and pushes her back (okay at this point I had to realize the impression I had from the first mention that he was about 13 was wrong). When she insists that she will call the police anyway he asks her \"have you ever been raped?\" By the time he had his hand between her legs I\\'d put the book down, and don\\'t plan to pick it up again.You who like this thing...enjoy. It\\'s not for me. Possibly just me but I prefer that my light reading contain as few rapes and/or attempted rapes as possible.It seems to me that whenever things slow up a bit or there\\'s a lull in the action the author goes for the groin. Not the best of literary devices.As I said if it\\'s your cup of tea, enjoy. To me it seems to be going the way of the only Laural K. Hamilton book I\\'ve tried.Keep it.First Grave on the Right by Darynda Jones is a 2011 St. Martin’s Press publication.Uproariously funny and Unique!!This is the first book in the Charley Davidson series. I’ve noticed a few of my GR friends have read books in this series and it seems to be popular, but I was not sure about diving into a paranormal/ urban fantasy series after burning out on the genre during the ‘Twilight’ craze. So, I initially passed on it.But, I am craving something otherworldly right now, so when I noticed a new installment in this series was coming out soon, and picking up a little chatter, I decided to see if this one would be a good fit for me.If this first book is any indication, then I’d say I could fall completely under the Charley Davidson’s scathing, testy, and snappy spell.Charley is a private investigator and a grim reaper. By grim reaper I mean she is able to see dead people and her job is to lure them into the light. To convince them, she often has to help them find peace by discovering who murdered them or finally getting justice on their behalf.With the help of her uncle, a deceased former gang member named, Angel, and her best friend, Cookie, Charley solves crimes, and helps the dead pass over. But, in her personal life, she’s coping with an unseen entity that visits her dreams in a super- hot sensual way. Finding who and what this entity is that has followed her around her entire life is her most fervent wish. But, as they say- Be careful what you wish for!I’ve read urban fantasy stories that were light and funny, some that were serious and super dark, but I’ve never read one that mixed such sharp wit and gallows humor, with action, adventure, dark fantasy, and a genuine murder mystery before. But, that’s not all! Capping it all off is a dangerous forbidden romance.I’m sold! I need to start another series like I need a hole in head, and I loathe the idea of binge reading, but I’m signing on for this one all the way.Can’t wait to read the next book!!'}, {'title': 'A Midsummer Night’s Dream', 'author': 'William Shakespeare, Barbara A.

Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law. On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first thing they see upon waking.

Get this.Hermia and Lysander are in love. But Hermia's dad wants her to marry Demetrius, and you know how dads can be about that sort of thing. For example, my husband really liked this boy that my oldest daughter dated several years ago. For the purposes of this review, we'll call him Kevin. In his eyes, Kevin was the best boyfriend his little girl could choose. My daughter didn't feel the same. As you may already know, daughters rarely like the guy their fathers want them to like.And now, because he's petty as hell, he refers to every poor boy that she brings home as Not-Kevin.Sometimes to their face.Now. Demetrius is determined to marry Hermia even though she obviously loathes him.Because some men find rejection sexy.And Helena is obsessed with Demetrius and follows him around like a puppy. Even though he obviously doesn't want her.Because some women find rejection sexy, too.You're probably wondering why Hermia and Lysander don't just give her father a bit of time to cool off with all this Demetrius stuff, right?Well, because if Hermia doesn't agree to marry Demetrius quick-like, her dad is going to send her to a convent (of Diana b/c this is set in Greece)orhave her killed, which is his right under the law...but probably just the convent.Harsh, right?This guy makesmyhusband look tactful, and as you may realize from the above-mentioned story, that's not an easy thing to do.So, Hermia and Lysander make plans to meet in the woods, run off to the big city, get hitched, and live happily ever after.Remember how I saidHelena is a bitch?Well, this is where Helena proves she is alevel 10 clingerthat will do anything for a scrap of attention.She rats her best friend Hermia's escape plan out to Demetrius!In the hopes that he...? What? Finds Hermia in time to stop her from marrying someone else? If Hermia is out of the picture, Demetrius will have to look elsewhere for matrimonial prospects!Helena is just shooting herself in the dick by telling him that her rival for his love is sneaking off to get married.Arealstalker would know this. <--just sayingShe's an idiot.And if Demetrius weren't such a douchebag, I probably would have felt a little sorry for him getting saddled with such an obvious crazypants for the rest of his life.Ok. Enter the fairies.They have their own problems. The biggest of which is that Oberon is apparently jealous of how much time Titania spends doting on the son of her (now dead) human friend.God, men are so weird!So what happens?Lots of bickering, lots of crying, lots of fairy dust getting thrown around on the wrong people, lots of mistaken love, and of course a dude with an asshead.Sounds freakishly similar to my early twenties.I'm sure you know the story. I think most everyone has seen or heardthisstory in one form or another in their life. And if you haven't read the original play and want to, it's pretty easy to get into. I've read it a few times, but this time around I listened to the full-cast audio version.It's excellent. And I'd suggest that as an option to anyone who is interested. After all, this was supposed to be acted out, so it works well when you have voice actors doing their thing to bring Shakespeare's story to life.Highly Recommended.how to flirt, shakespeare style, a midsummer nights dream edition:- elope with your love in a fairy wood- follow your friends into the fairy wood with your ex-fiancé, who you still pine over even though he loves another woman- become entranced by magic flower juice and chase after the wrong girl until you fall over with exhaustion- call your girl an acorn- realise your ex-fiancé is truly the one you love, even though you ditched her once you got to the woods- have a double wedding with your lover, your friend, and the f-boi who used to love youi guess its true what they say - the course of true love never did run smooth.↠3.5 starsA Midsummer Night's Dream, William ShakespeareA Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96.It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta, the former queen of the Amazons.These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanical's) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set.The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.تاریخ نخستین خوانش: روز پنجم ماه جولای سال 2007میلادیعنوان: رویا در شب نیمه تابستان؛ نویسنده: ویلیام شکسپیر؛ مترجم: مسعود فرزاد؛ تهران، انتشارات ناهید؛ چاپ چهارم 1390؛ در 185ص؛ شابک 9789646205468؛ موضوع: نمایشنامه های نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 16مموضوع نمایش\\u200cنامه اینکه عشق را با عقل کاری نیست،\\u200c بلکه همانند شاعری و دیوانگی، تابع خیال است؛ همراه خیال به وجود می\\u200cآید، شدت یا ضعف پیدا می\\u200cکند، و از میان می\\u200cرود؛ دکتر «جرج براندس، دانمارکی»، در ضمن انتقاد از این درام، در تایید همین باور مینویسند: «بشر دست\\u200cخوش غرایز، و رویاهای خویش است، و مدام یا خودش را گول می\\u200cزند، و یا کسی دیگر او را فریب می\\u200cدهد»؛چکیده: «تسوس، دوک آتن»، قرار است ماه آینده، چله ی تابستان، در شبی که ماه قرص کامل است، با «هیپولیتا» ازدواج کند؛ بنابراین «تسوس» به «فیلوسترانه» رئیس تشریفات و جشن و سرورهای خود، فرمان می\\u200cدهد، برنامه \\u200cای بریزد، تا آن شب، جوانان «آتنی» واقعاً به عیش و نوش بپردازند؛ اما همگی جوانان «آتنی»، از این موضوع خوشحال نیستند؛ «لیساندر» و «دیمیتریوس»، که از کودکی با هم دوست بوده \\u200cاند، هردو عاشق «هرمیای» زیبا، و ریزه میزه، دختر همسایه ی \\u200cخویش هستند، و مشکل پیچیده ای دارند؛ «اژئوس» پدر «هرمیا»، دو پا را در یک کفش کرده، که دخترش باید شب عروسی «دوک»، و در حضور «دوک»، با «دیمیتریوس» ازدواج کند، وگرنه «هرمیا» را می\\u200cکشد، یا به معبد کاهنان می\\u200cفرستد، که تا پایان زندگی، همان\\u200cجا ترشیده بماند، حال آنکه کسی در آن محله ی «آتن» نیست، که نداند «هرمیا»، از بچگی عاشق «لیساندر» بوده \\u200cاست…؛تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 23/07/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ 05/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانیRe-reading the play this time, I couldn't stop thinking aboutThe Magic Flute.Like Mozart's opera, Shakespeare's play may have a silly plot composed of fanciful, seemingly arbitrary elements, yet, through the power of absolute artistic mastery, the framework of what might otherwise be nothing but a second-rate masque is transformed, by the unwearied attention of genius--and in Shakespeare's case, sublime poetry--into a work of great resonance, an archetypal myth.Lovers flee the authority of a father who is contrary to them, a lover who pursues the one he loves and does not love her, accompanied by the one who loves him and does not love him. - You follow meThere is nothing very original you will say to me. Still, there is also theatre and magic in the forest. Worlds intermingle in joyful confusion. Artisans from Athens come to rehearse a play for the king's wedding. Fairy and facetious beings, bewitching, a magical flower that lavishes all the energy of love for the first creature seen upon awakening - even if it had the head of an ass.There's no need for a villain in The Dream to hold the viewer in suspense. Problems fly away by magic; you have to let yourself be bewitched. This piece feels like weightlessness, celebrating theatrical play, the beneficial lightness, and the beautiful fantasy of the imagination that frees us from the weight of reality. And it's so good!\"}]\n"

While he agrees to help April, he needs a favor too: she'll pretend to be his girlfriend at an upcoming family dinner, so that he can avoid the lectures about settling down and having a more \\\"serious\\\" career than high school coach and gym teacher.

Who am I kidding? I'm not sorry. I love him so much, even Simon pales in comparison.This book was such a fun, addictive read. And I'm not just saying this because I adore Mitch. I'm saying this because I also adore our protagonist, April. She's been through a lot and has built a wall around herself, and I loved watching her learn how to come out of her shell over the course of this book. Her dynamic with Mitch was so fun to watch, and did I mention there's the fake dating trope? And only one bed? This book spoils us.Now, if you've read Jen DeLuca's previous books, you probably already have an idea of what to expect from the writing. It's grounded, relatable, with plenty of wit. What I love a lot about this book, that we didn't see much in the previous two, is the actual town of Willow Creek. We know the Ren Faire well by now, but through April's eyes we see the downsides of such a small town.But don't worry, we still get some time on Faire grounds. It definitely isn't as big of a part of this book as it is the first, or even really the second, but I appreciated the glimpses of it we got. And the rest of the plot and characters made up for the lack of Renaissance escapism.In the end, this was a fantastic installment in a series that made me spend way too much money on my own Ren Faire dress (no, technically Jen DeLuca didn't force me to buy it, but I am blaming her).I'm going to miss Mitch and April, but I already cant wait for my next reread.-Thoughts Before Reading-I just got a renaissance dress for when I go to the ren faire later this year so, of course, I reread this entire series and am finally gonna start my ARC of book 3Also, somehow I don't think I've read the description before now (I just knew it was Mitch and April's story and was sold) and there's FAKE DATING?!?!? I could not be more excited to read thisthis is cute! if you love the tried and true fake dating trope, along with a \\u2018theres only one bed\\u2019 situation and a ren faire, then this is the book for you!and while i do think this installment is an improvement from the second book in terms of character chemistry and overall plot, im feeling a little bummed by it. i think ive just read too many fake dating stories lately that im becoming a little turned off by the trope altogether. not this books fault by any means, so its unfortunate i happened to make this discovery whilst reading this. im just a little let down that this doesnt offer anything more than a \\u2018fake dating, development of real feelings, denying those feelings, and finally a grand gesture to win them back\\u2019 format. i definitely think this story had more than enough room to include more content or more character development.but again, if you want an ever reliable fake dating story, you will want to pick this up. its quick and light and gets the job done.\\u21a03.5 starsOh boy! I was waiting for devouring Mitch\\u2019s book since I\\u2019ve read \\u201cWell Met\\u201d, irresistible sexy god in killing kilts: I fantasized the character someone between Outlander\\u2019s Sam Heughan meets James McAvoy and when I rethought that image, my cheeks got hurt because of too much grinning!At the second book, when the author gave us impression something can happen between Emily\\u2019s supportive sister April ( whose tragic accident is the beginning of entire series ) and charm in kilt a.k.a. Mitch, I got so excited!April finally raised her daughter Caitlin alone, who is about to graduate and leave for the college. She already gets stressed because Caitlin\\u2019s douchebag father who was never in the picture plans to reconnect with her daughter. And her decision to sell the house and move an apartment closer to her work place idea was not taken well by Caitlin. April has to deal with her silent treatment.And Mitch\\u2026 hottest gym teacher of the town is helpful enough for her house renovations in exchange a quick favor: she has to act like Mitch\\u2019s girlfriend during his grandparents\\u2019 anniversary because he\\u2019s sick of his family\\u2019s interrogation about his personal life and he wants to prove them he can be in a serious relationship like smart, mature, strong woman like her.But when their pretending game gets out of control and what if they don\\u2019t want to pretend anymore!Well, April is scared: she\\u2019s living secluded life, single mother, giving up everything for so long, a little mundane, always responsible one as Mitch picks up women at bars, having too many flings, easy going, flirty, sarcastic, ten years younger than him.She may risk so much by having relationship with him. Could she live her comfort zone ? Could she be his girlfriend under prying eyes of townies?Overall: Well- Met is still my most favorite book of the series, but I loved this one more than second book. Thankfully Emily, Stacey, Simon and Daniel stated as supporting characters. Because in my opinion, second book\\u2019s only problem was we read about two couples at the same time. There was not much differentiation between MCs and supporting characters.I\\u2019m so happy this book only concentrated on April and Mitch\\u2019s blossoming romance. Both of them were amazing. I already loved two of them from the previous books so I\\u2019m happy to see they ended up together.I wish the story narrated by both April and Mitch. I would truly enjoy to read his perspective, how he started to fall for April, how he dealt with his parents\\u2019 criticism about his life choices. From the beginning of the series, he was one of my favorite characters so I would love to spend more time in his head!Anyways, it was still feel good and extra swoon worthy read and it was amazing to return back to Renaissance Faire!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.This is going to be the best one in the series, I just know Mitch and April are going tobring it!thank you to berkley for providing me with an e-arc for review3.5 starsTropes/themes: fake dating; single mom; age gap (older woman/younger man); himbo man; social anxietyI\\u2019ve been looking forward to this book since the first book in this companion series came out and this romance was teased. Sadly, it didn\\u2019t quite live up to how much I adored book 1. With the fake dating trope, I think they got together too soon and then a lot of the book was mostly our main character being really avoidant and commitment phobic and not using her words. I did still pull for them though and wanted them to work out even though she was being a little too emotionally unavailable for my liking. I also wish her personal arc and development was a little better as it felt a bit half baked to me.One side note that I love about this series is none of the characters have a happily ever after that features having kids or hinting that they will have kids. Multiple character discuss being child free and that\\u2019s something you don\\u2019t see a lot in romance.I still plan to continue with this series if Jen DeLuca keeps writing books in this world.\",\n          \"3.5 - \\u2b50\\ufe0f\\u2b50\\ufe0f\\u2b50\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udcabIt feels surreal to have finally read a book I've been anticipating for two years and I am a sobbing mess after finishing the HOFAS. I'm already missing these characters so much.The following review will contain major spoilers fromHouse of Flame and Shadowso if you haven't finished reading I advise you not to read this review until then.Also, Sarah recently confirmed Crescent City book 4 is happening (probably in a few years). This one is a conclusion for Bryce's story.[MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW]...................................This book was one hell of an emotional ride and it might come as a surprise that I haven't rated it 5-star, but the more I thought about the book the more issues I found in it so I decided to deduct it from my 4-star rating to 3.5-star which is how I feel.I got some theories right which I'm very excited about, I also got some theories wrong which was expected because I knew Sarah would throw a curveball at me in this book. It's fun to explore the possibilities as a reader but also I love it when the author surprises me and Sarah did, especially in part 1!!!Let's begin with the ACOTAR segment:Keep in mind that SJM changed the timeline gap she originally intended between ACOSF and HOFAS (which was around 6-9 months in her first draft)The gap between ACOSF's ending and HOFAS events isapproximately 3 months(Nesta said she killed Lanthys 7 months ago, which happened a month before Winter Solstice in ACOSF). So it's June/beginning of Summer in the ACOTAR world.The Middengard Worm making a cameo was not on my bingo card.- Nesta deserves a 5\\u2b50\\ufe0f for being the badass that she was in all the scenes. I loved seeing her in action and to see glimpses of the warm person behind an ice cold mask she mastered wearing. We see more of her sentimental side when Bryce plays music (in the bonus chapter) and when Nesta bids Ember and co. farewell. Nesta is set up to be an important player in ACOTAR5 now that she was left with Gwydion/Starsword and to find out why she got the eight-pointed star tattoo.- Azriel, my beloved, also deserves a 5\\u2b50\\ufe0f. Seeing the spymaster and the Shadowsinger in action alongside Nesta was fun but also the crumbs SJM littered in the ACOTAR segment for him makes me even more thrilled for his arc in ACOTAR5, now that is a protagonist that is being well-prepped for his own book. We touch upon his mother and fondness of music in the bonus chapter, we still don't know how he got Truth-teller and the fact that his precious knife was originally owned by Enalius (the first of the Illyrians) and that is another tie to Illyria, we don't know how his shadows and magic work, he finds out through the Asteri under the Prison that the Illyrians were made by them, and honestly SJM gave more than what I expected when it comes to him. His personality is even more fleshed out and to my delight many of my friends and readers are warming up to him (he always had a personality you just needed to look closer).\\\"[...] that wasn't there as Azriel landed fromabove them. His wings were spread so wide they nearly touched either side of the cavern.\\\"Thank you Janet for confirming who has the largest wingspan yet again.- Now, Nesta and Azriel as a duo are incredible!!! I love their bond and friendship and seeing how much they look out and care about each other. They understand one another and that has been obvious to us since ACOSF, they both master putting on an icy mask to hide their emotions.Rhysand alongside Amren made a brief appearance at the beginning of the book and he seems apprehensive about the Asteri and the fact that anyone can walk into their world (I think we will see implications of that in ACOTAR5 being that Rhys saw two alien females fall into his world only months apart). He'll grapple with the question of who else can enter their world and how do they put a stop to it.I loved the ACOTAR segment so much because it was lore galore and I was craving all that info dump since ACOSF.The whole history of High King Fionn, Queen Theia, and Pelias was darker than I expected and I'm glad Fionn did not turn out to be evil. I still feel enraged and devastated with what happened with Helena and Silene (Theia's daughters). It's almost impossible to excuse their actions but it is still sad that Theia damned her own family and people because she thirsty for more power.I can't wait to see what more will be revealed in ACOTAR5!The ACOTAR-related bonus chapters include: Walmart edition (Bryce, Nesta, Azriel) + BAM/Indigo (Ember and Randall).My current theory is some of the events in ACOTAR5 will happen in parallel with HOFAS (at least the first 30% of the book).To conclude this part, I'm glad the crossover did not take over a big chunk of the book because it IS a Crescent City book.I wasn't rooting for a major crossover either with Throne of Glass (as much as it pains me to say it because I miss them), it would've tangled up all 3 series and we would end up with a messy storyline. Major crossovers work for movies, not for books.The crossover was important for ACOTAR and CC because they are tied by history and we got answers that are important for both. We got resolution for it in this book, but not yet for ACOTAR. I didn't clarify earlier, we did get some TOG crumbs but it doesn't have the same level of implications as ACOTAR and it does leave the door open for a future crossover, but as of now we know most of TOG storylines had their resolution but Sarah did leave the door open for more stories.Now... moving on toCrescent CityI was rooting for Bryce but I did find her reckless and insufferable in many moments. It makes me miss HOEAB Bryce but in this book she's coming off too much self-absorbed.It's hard for me to buy the suprise schemes Bryce pre-planned, I mean it works for a character like Aelin but not Bryce. Certain scenes are convincing and some came out of the blue or were too convenient.Hunt is my darling and it was obvious throughout the book he is hesitant and triggered by his trauma since Shahar's rebellion so he will question every step they take, and Bryce seems pretty dismissive to him during those moments which... is not doing her any favors. She's not helping him through it and it makes my heart break even more for Hunt because he is so wary of upsetting her about it. Like, Bryce darling... he went through very gruesome torture sessions recently so cut him so slack.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Quinlar and I'm always rooting for them but... I hoped we would be past their trust issues and disagreements over minor things. I still want them to argue and fight, I don't want them to be a perfect couple but all this still rubbed me the wrong way.I also expected a soul-shattering, emotional reunion after the whole \\\"our love spans across time and universes\\\" quote but I felt underwhelmed with what I got given one of them was in another universe and the other was being tortured.Still, I got many other moments that I loved and cried and gushed over. Especially their bonus chapter!On the other hand, I devoured all of Ruhn and Lidia's chapters. Lidia's chapters especially are just *chef's kiss*.This book made me fall in love with them more and I was eating up all the angst, all the longing, and the intense sexual tension between them.I wish they got their own book though I need more of them.There were a few surprises about Lidia that I did not expect but I also love that for her and it helped to better understand her motivations.The chapters I struggled with the most are Ithan's and Tharion's. I'm sorry but they were a snoozefest except for a few scenes.I'm happy with what Ithan became and the resolution he got towards the end of the book, but the whole Fendyr/Reaper storyline wasn't all that interesting. At least I got more of Jesiba who also has her own very interesting backstory.Also, totally rooting for him and Perry.Tharion's chapters didn't get interesting to me until Sathia came into the picture. It's painful to see him make one miserable decision after another. It's like Sarah testing how much can one character fuck up.Sathia was a delightful surprise, I didn't expect Flynn's sister who made her seem to be nothing but trouble come off as a compelling character. I hope we get her POV in CC4. I want to explore a Fae female's POV who lived among the Fae and how their views and treatment of females turned her into who she is and how she can move on from it.I'm a big fan of marriage of convenience trope so I'll consume all of it (if SJM manages to make Tharion more likable).Flynn (and his sprites), Declan, Baxian played important roles and I still adore them. I just can't help but think of how Baxian will live on without his mate Danika, it hurts.I was totally bamboozled by who Hunt's father is, let's just say he was conceived through team effort. He has three dads.Moving on to the villains:I'll start with the character that had the most satisfying death and it's Pollux. Lidia the female that you are. It was perfection.I didn't like how the Autumn King and King Morven of Avallen were off'ed. It felt too convenient and I wanted a more satisfying resolution between Bryce/Ruhn and the Autumn King. He can get killed all over again for all I care, I just hoped it would be under a different scenario.Good riddance Sabine is dead.I expected something more in the final confrontation with the Asteri but it wasn't as epic as I expected it to be. I mean I'm glad they're gone but I don't know... it was too easy. I don't think it even took 50 pages to off them.I felt like every villain was eliminated way too easily and way too conveniently. I think it would've been better to spread out their deaths between HOSAB and HOFAS.I'm glad that we saw Aidas, Apollion, and Thanatos but I was hoping for an epic battle between them and the Asteri. That one was too quick.There is one trope Sarah likes to pull in the climax but I'm getting bored of it because she did it too many times to the point it no longer is impactful as it intends to be.Another thing that threw me off was shift between different character POVs mid chapter which felt like a whiplash and needed better formatting. To me I don't think Sarah is weak when it comes to writing multiple POVs (look at Throne of Glass), but for some reason it didn't have a smooth flow in this book.Overall, I did enjoy parts of book but Sarah took a big risk with the crossover.Though will say I'm left with questions like:\\u2022 What happened to the comms Crystal Ruhn gave Bryce before she escaped to Prythian?\\u2022 What about all the Thurr connections and comparisons to Hunt?\\u2022 What's the point of Ariadne and her dragon flame being able to burn even Princes of Hel?\\u2022 Did we just forget about Viktoria?\\u2022 Octartis (the Asteri) was a female in HOSAB, but in HOFAS it's a male?There are obvious continuity errors, typos and inconsistencies this book suffered from.Don't let my review impact your experience with this book or your rating, I love these characters and this world and I will miss them dearly but I always planned to keep my review transparent when it comes to this book. Sarah is one of my all-time favorite authors and half of her books are 5-stars to me so you'll know it will take a lot to sway me from that rating.I will definitely revisit these books in the future, I have attachment issues with Sarah's books.I will end this review with my favorite quote in HOFAS that made me sob even harder the moment I read it because of what it meant to these characters and to me.The friends they\\u2019d made were what mattered in the end. Not the enemies.Through love, all is possible.Thank you Sarah for another emotional journey I'm forever grateful for the stories and the characters you always gift us \\u2764\\ufe0f3\\u2b50\\ufe0f Definitely had its moments but it wasn\\u2019t my favorite.***This review containsSPOILERSso if you have not read HOFAS or the previous books in the series, STOP SCROLLING ***PS: If you want to read the bonus chapters, I have them ALL on my story highlights on Instagram @thebiglittlelibrary \\ud83e\\udef6 My favorites are Target's & BAM's!...Here's a fun, little summary of what happens:\\u2728 ACOTAR crossover\\u2728 Bryce eats a magic bean\\u2728 Middengard Worm cameo\\u2728 History lesson with a ghost\\u2728 Nesta slayyyyyys\\u2728 Tharion is an idiot\\u2728 Baxian gets hungry in the dungeons\\u2728 Ithan packs one hell of a punch\\u2728 Lidia Cervos serves cunt\\u2728 Boring Quinlar reunion\\u2728 \\\"We All Live In A Yellow Submarine\\\" \\ud83c\\udfb6\\u2728 Lidia's is legit Mother\\u2728 Lots of sad boi energy\\u2728 Hunt has a wardrobe malfunction \\ud83c\\udf46\\u2728 Asteri just being their usual asshole selves\\u2728 Hypaxia is . . . there\\u2728 \\u201cDon\\u2019t Fear The Reaper\\u201d \\ud83c\\udfb6\\u2728 A random arranged marriage\\u2728 Hel is DTF with an alliance\\u2728 Hunt learns he was a test tube baby\\u2728 Parricide \\ud83d\\udc4f\\u2728 Avallen gets a makeover\\u2728 Bryce becomes death\\u2728 Ithan nuts up\\u2728 Hypaxia cures COVID\\u2728 Epic final battle\\u2728 Hel + sprites to the rescue\\u2728AelinLidia serves even more cunt\\u2728 Pollux gets fucked\\u2728 \\\"Super Massive Black Hole\\\" \\ud83c\\udfb6\\u2728 Bryce takes a trip to space\\u2728 Hunt becomes Iron Man\\u2728 Jesiba pulls a Ben Solo\\u2728 Happily Ever After\\u2728 My Little Pony reboot\\u2728 House of Many Waters COMING SOON featuring Tharion (and Ithan)My Thoughts:Was it a bad story? No. But was it the best? No. There were things I liked and didn't like. I'll be going over all of it. So buckle the fuck up because this is going to be one hell of a review.First, I want to address the ACOTAR crossover.Honestly, I'm indifferent about it all. I was surprised we mostly see Bryce interacting with just Nesta and Azriel, but I wasn't mad about it. I actually liked Bryce and Nesta's interactions and could DEFINITELY see them as friends under different circumstances. But honestly, Nesta was the best part of this entire crossover. Even after ACOSF I wasn\\u2019t a huge Nesta fan but after this, I really like her. I enjoyed seeing her from a total stranger's perspective!The entire point of the crossover was learning about Theia and her connection to the ACOTAR world - and it did its job there. HOWEVER, knowing that Hel knew the same history and could have easily shared this with Bryce is where my problem with the crossover comes in. If Hel had stepped in to give Bryce all the information (which Aidas says he didn't do because 'Bryce wasn't ready'), there would be no need for a crossover. I mean, I guess at some point she\\u2019d have to visit the Fae world to absorb Silene\\u2019s Starborn power, but I believe it could have been done without even seeing any of the ACOTAR characters. Which pretty much makes me believe SJM did this as a fan service and/or as a way to get fans who haven't read CC, to read it. It was a genius marketing strategy, but I don't think it did much for the story. And unfortunately, I\\u2019m hearing from quite a few people that the crossover disappointed them. So, in the end, it may have backfired on SJM. But if you enjoyed the crossover, I'd like to know and hear your thoughts on why. \\ud83d\\ude0aWhat I liked:The overall plot.Listen, I gotta give it to SJM, she sure knows how to weave a story together. It's wild to me that even the smallest of details tend to have some significance later on in the story - things you may not have even realized are of any importance at all. I enjoyed the journey we've been on since book one, and I thought how everything came together by the end was phenomenal.The insanity and possibilities of the Maasverse.I am still reeling from all the connections Midgard has to the worlds of ACOTAR and TOG. We mostly focus on the connections to the ACOTAR realm (the Fae home world) but we get some bits and pieces of the ties to the TOG realm thanks to the stories from Aidas and Jesiba. I am honestly in awe of how Sarah J. Maas is able to keep all this information straight and continue to build upon it. This is what I really admire and respect about the Crescent City series. From a fantasy standpoint, I think it was incredibly well done. This is a complex world with a complex history and magic system that can definitely be understood by a first time reader, but is probably appreciated more by those who've read her other series. I'm excited to see what Sarah does next in terms of connecting these worlds in the future.History lessons with Theia's daughter, Silene.This was so freaking cool. I absolutely LOVED learning more about our beloved ACOTAR world as well as the beginnings of Midgard and the role the Asteri played in all of it. It was a lot darker than I expected, which made it that much more interesting. The only thing I predicted beforehand was that the Prison was the Dusk Court, but besides that everything else was new information and super fun to learn about!Lidia mother-fucking Cervos.She is a baddie. Period. End of story. The things she's done. . . the things she's put herself through for years all for the sake of her sons. . . I'm in awe. Lidia is the definition of strength. Her backstory was so heartbreaking. I legitimately cried. The way she sacrifices her entire being (mind, body, and soul) really reminded me of the way Rhys sacrificed himself while under the mountain. Both these characters put on a mask and became monsters in order to protect the ones they love. Even how they act after they are free and deal with the trauma is very similar. There's a lot of parallels between the two, which is why I probably love them both so much. Honestly, Lidia is my favorite character of the entire series and I wish we'd gotten more time with her. Also, the fact she\\u2019s a descendent of King Brannon from the TOG world and therefore related to Aelin and Dorian in some way was not a surprise but super cool nevertheless.Lidia and Ruhn's romance.These two have my whole heart. \\ud83e\\udef6 I absolutely ADORE them! They're probably my second favorite mated couple besides Feysand. They went through absolute hell in this book. Ruhn getting tortured and Lidia having to participate was so hard to stomach. Lidia saving Ruhn's life and nearly dying only for him to say\\u201cYou\\u2019re dead to me,\\u201dmade me want to scream. And finding out Lidia has children and her real motives for being the Hind absolutely broke my heart. \\ud83d\\ude2d They endure so much in such a short amount of time, and even though there was so much broken trust between them, they're able to accept the past and be there for one another. Lidia and Ruhn deserved their HEA. And if you haven't yet, RUN to the link in my bio at @thebiglittlelibrary and read their bonus chapter because it is so perfect!Ithan's character arc and story development.Did his rise to power feel a bit random and rushed? Yes. But I didn't expect it, so I liked that his story wasn't predictable - especially when he kills Sigrid by punching her through the throat. I GASPED so hard. lol Ithan was actually someone who really annoyed me in book two - he was immature and seemed lost - but his guilt for killing Sigrid takes him on a journey that ends with him coming into his own and finding his purpose as Prime. He grew up a lot and I honestly wouldn't be mad about seeing more of his story in future CC books. I'm also excited by the fact he has the elemental power of snow! Just another connection to the TOG world.What I didn't like:The multiple, mid-chapter POV changes DROVE ME NUTS.This was probably my biggest issue. Most of the chapters had three different POVs. And at the beginning of the book, there were four main plots happening at the same time: Bryce in the Fae home world; Hunt, Ruhn, and Baxian being tortured, Tharion with the Viper Queen, and Ithan and the other random side characters trying to figure out wtf to do. So each chapter, we'd follow one character and just as things were starting to ramp up, we'd shift to another character in a completely different situation. Because of these constantly changing POV, the story didn't flow well and I wasn't able to truly immerse myself. I felt removed while reading. Maybe if each chapter had only focused on one, maybe two (max) POVs, the story might not have felt so disjointed.The predictable ending.While I enjoyed the Asteri plot, I thought the ending was predictable and incredibly low stakes (since you know no one important is going to actually die and stay dead). This could be because I've read SJM's other series and have noticed some patterns and similarities to how she writes her endings. The allying with the 'dark' forces of Hel, the sprites showing up last minute, the Lidia and Pollux confrontation, and Bryce dying and coming back to life, felt similar to the end of ACOWAR. And while the ending had a different plot, the familiarity of it all didn't allow for me to feel any surprise. It definitely wasn't a bad ending . . . I just didn't really pull me in.The story is plot heavy with not enough character / relationship growth.There was too much going on plot-wise with too many different storylines and too many POVs. While everything neatly came together in the end, the journey to get there was messy and overly complex. I think SJM could have found a way to simplify the plot and cut some POVs to make this easier to digest. But at the same time, because there was so much focus on the plot, a few of the characters and relationships didn't get the attention they deserved. Specifically, Hunt and Ruhn dealing with the trauma from their torture, Lidia dealing with her trauma, Ruhn and Lidia's relationship (see below), Ithan's and his character arc, and Tharion as a whole because what growth has he even gone through throughout this entire series?Not only did Ruhn and Lidia not get enough screen time to truly work through their trauma, trust issues, and anger, but THEY WERE ROBBED of a beautiful romance journey.(Sort of how we were robbed of more Elorcan in TOG.) I totally get the need for more plot in this book because it's the ending to the series and things need to wrap up. However, we barely scratched the surface of Ruhn and Lidia's romance in HOSAB. And then in this book, things are bad for a while before they come together without spending adequate time resolving any issues, healing from their traumas, and growing as a couple. I understand that it wasn't possible to do this in an already 838 page book, but I truly believe other things should have been cut to make their story more impactful. Or, I think they shouldn't have been a couple at the end so we'd get a book that focuses on Ruhn and Lidia. Regardless, I think not diving deep into their story was a missed opportunity.Hunt and Bryce's 'reunion'.This was one of the most anticlimactic scenes in the entire book. I was expecting Hunt and Bryce to immediately jump into each other's arms . . . to sob . . . to kiss . . . and say some incredibly romantic and sappy shit to one another. BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENS. After everything they went through to find each other again, this was not the reunion I was hoping for.Hunt and Bryce as a coupleListen, I don't want to get into it but I don't think they have chemistry. Compared to SJM's other couples, they're definitely one of the weaker pairings. I get that in the story, they supposedly have this insane connection that spans across time and space, but I just never felt it. Side note: I LEGIT forgot they were married. \\ud83d\\ude02If you like Bryce and Hunt (and the rest of the Crescent City characters), I believe you'll really enjoy this story. But if you've struggled to like or even connect with most of them, this story will probably disappoint you.Unfortunately, I fall in the latter group. As a whole, I think the CC characters are a bunch of immature idiots who act more like the stereotypical frat guys and sorority girls than people capable of saving the world. I mean, the majority of the characters are in their 20s but even the ones who are older still act childish at times.Bryce.I'm sorry, but she's my least favorite SJM FMC. She's a selfish, immature, pick-me girl. If I had to read another sentence about how hot she was according to EVERY SINGLE GUY besides her brother, and listen to more of her shitty jokes (which EVERY SINGLE GUY thinks is so fucking funny), I was going to scream. And I get Bryce is a sarcastic bitch to everyone, but there's a time and a place for everything, and being obnoxious doesn't ever actually get anyone anywhere.Bryce also isn't a character that earned my respect as The Chosen One. Let's look at the origins of SJM's other main FMCs. Feyra was a hunter and Aelin was an assassin, while Bryce was . . . a party girl? The other FMCs proved themselves to be worthy of being the Chosen One but Bryce had zero skills to qualify her as a fighter or good leader yet somehow she was able to amass a group of people to follow her. Also, she never learned new skills. She solely relied on her inherited powers and the skills of others. Nepotism at its finest.Bryce was incredibly selfish when she unleashed an Asteri onto the Fae home world without a second thought for the millions of lives there . . . all because she wants answers, which she doesn\\u2019t really even get! Thank the Cauldron Nesta was there to save the day! And then, when Bryce tells Hunt, her supposed soulmate, to sack up and get over his trauma. Girl, WHAT?!Lastly, Bryce hating ALL fae because she\\u2019s had some bad experiences with a few seems incredibly close minded and just plain stupid. What about the fae in her life like Ruhn, Declan, Flynn and countless others who are kind and fight for what\\u2019s right? Apparently they don\\u2019t count. But how dumb is she to write off an entire race/species based on the actions of a few?Tharion.I didn't care for him in book one. I disliked him in book two. And I absolutely hate him in book three. I mean, does ANYONE like Tharion? Please, if you do, let me know in the comments and tell me why because I must be missing something. From what we've seen, he is a selfish, immature, fuck boi that doesn't go through any character growth throughout this ENTIRE series. I was extremely annoyed that his POV took up a huge chunk of this book when it added little to this story. But it looks like SJM was mainly setting things up for him (and Ithan) to be the MCs in her next CC book. \\ud83d\\ude44 I know I'll read it because it's SJM, but I won't be happy about it. He better undergo a serious transformation, like Nesta in ACOSF, or else that'll be the end of my CC journey.So many side characters that don't matter.Declan and Flynn.Okay, Declan's THE tech guy who only has use whenever SJM needed someone to hack something. How convenient. \\ud83d\\ude44 But Flynn . . . I CANNOT for the life of me remember anything useful he did.Baxian.He's Danika's mate. Cool. And? I guess he's a hunk of meat that Bryce can call on during a fight. But as a character, he's not THAT special.Sigrid.She had so much potential but only propelled Ithan's character arc forward. Super pointless but probably setting up for the next book.Sathia.The most random of all characters. She pops up out of nowhere (I genuinely forgot Flynn had a sister) and married Tharion? This has to be a setup for the next book, but it just added another unnecessary piece to an already overly complicated story.Fury and Juniper.Bryce's ONLY female friends and I forgot about them lol. The fact Fury doesn't play an active role in this series is another missed opportunity. What's the point in Bryce having a badass friend if she doesn't even help??? I truly believe Sarah could and should have cut out a few of these people to simplify the story.Aidas' reason for not just telling Bryce the entire truth about everything was flimsy.Apparently, it's because \\\"Bryce wasn't ready\\\". He couldn't risk her telling the wrong person and the Asteri finding out. So instead, he'd rather have Bryce go on an insane goose chase and risk her life doing a bunch of other dangerous shit because he didn't think he could tell her the truth and convince her to keep her mouth shut. This entire situation just brought up my PTSD from when Danika withheld the truth from Bryce. Riddle me this, how is it that someone who no one seems to trust ends up with the most power and becomes the savior of Midgard??I also found it strange that Hel, a realm that has been trying to eradicate the Asteri for 15,000 years from Midgard and is currently helping other realms fight these beings, are fine sitting back, letting millions, if not, billions die throughout the years. From what I remember, after the initial rebellion with Theia, they tried helping once by creating the Thunderbirds. But that was eons ago and I don't believe they really tried since. It's like they were fine waiting till one of Theia's heirs was ready to take on the mantle and become the catalyst for a successful rebellion. But again, once they found Bryce, they didn't do shit to help her understand her powers or the history of Midgard and the Asteri. Ugh. Why??? There just isn't a good enough reason. So overall, I think Hel not stepping in more didn't make sense for a realm that is 'eager' to help the universe, but also Aidas not revealing the whole truth earlier was such a cop-out and made Hel's entire involvement useless until it was convenient for the story.Overall, House of Flame and Shadow was an okay conclusion to the Crescent City series. I enjoyed how everything came full circle and how SJM scratches the surface of the multiverse. Sarah J. Maas is still one of my favorite authors, and even though this may not have been my favorite book, I respect the hell out of her and admire her. She's created some of the most magical worlds and stories that have changed a generation of readers, so she'll always hold a special place in my heart. I am excited for the next ACOTAR book, but I do hope she does what she does best and gives us a story with the perfect combination of a compelling plot, character growth, and romance. And for the love of god please don\\u2019t let it have more than 2 POVs.Favorite Quotes:\\u201cYou\\u2019re as much of a monster as they are.\\u201d\\u201cLove will do that to you.\\u201d_______For Bryce, home was - and always would be - Hunt._______\\u201cYou\\u2019re a prince, start acting like one.\\u201d_______\\u201cI don\\u2019t fucking care who you are, so long as you\\u2019re mine.

Because it's 1 AM and tomorrow 5 of my bookish friends are coming to spend the weekend at my place, I'm going to post some of my raw notes because I don't want to leave you hanging. The plan is to come back on Monday and edit these into something easier to read lol. Don't expect these to be in an order that makes sense. There will be loads of spelling errors, ya just gotta deal until I can edit.With that said,SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT...FuryThe fact that all we \\u201cused\\u201d was her ability to pilot a helicopter is an embarrassment. Not to mention that this series was supposed to be about female friendships. We just, do away with fury and juniper altogether in this book. Stupid. Also, Fury literally makes a scoff about how all she\\u2019s doing is playing babysitter and I was like UH YEAH. THE FUCK?JesibaThere should have been breadcrumbs. We should have seen her interact with SOMEONE who knows Appolion *ahem, Aidas* and had her trash talk him. Then we\\u2019d be like what\\u2019s her beef?Book of breathings/library of parthosbig old plot hole. Disappointing.reunion between Bryce and Huntone of the things that made me SO ANGRYYYYYY like in the moment I was walking around saying \\u201cthe fuck??? Wait WHAT???\\u201d I don\\u2019t see Pete for 24 hours and I will leap into that man\\u2019s arms. You\\u2019re telling me that *mates* who\\u2019ve been tortured and never knew if they\\u2019d find their way back to one another were going to like the fucking Ocean Queen stop them from falling into each other\\u2019s arms??? You cannot tell me they shouldn\\u2019t have been sobbing together. bullshit.Lack of character dev.I was surprised by this. I expected the book to at least take place over the course of a month, not like, a week. I get we don\\u2019t tend to change as humans thaaaaat much over a week but it's historically been something I appreciate that in her writing and we got none of it.Silene / Princes of Hel info dumpsI could go on and on here, but in essence, it\\u2019s bloody infuriating that there were people who knew everything all along and never guided or drop-fed that info to us over the three books. \\u201cYou weren\\u2019t ready\\u201d I WANTED TO THROW MY PHONE what a cop-out. Secondly, by sharing all this info all at once, the reader doesn\\u2019t get to chew on any of it, the think about what it means. We\\u2019re just hanging on for dear life trying to take it all in. It\\u2019s like someone tossing us a ball\\u2026 versus having a cannon full of tennis balls shot at you all at onceGeneral messiness/she bit off more than she could chewWhen I\\u2019m over here wishing that she\\u2019d kill some characters off, just so that we could have some emotional impact AND narrow the field, we\\u2019ve got a big problem. I think about Chekov\\u2019s Gun all the time when I\\u2019m reading\\u2026 the rule in writing that if you include an element, you should use it by the book\\u2019s conclusion. And she just\\u2026 doesn\\u2019t. I\\u2019ve never been more convinced than I am now after HoFaS that SJM doesn\\u2019t actually have some crisp master plan. She just leaves a fuck-tonne of Chekov\\u2019s Guns lying around, and picks them up willy nilly when it sort of works in a future book. That\\u2019s why it feels so messy, plot-hole-y, and just kind of ???the (anti)climaxthe whole final fight scene was anticlimactic, it never felt like anyone was actually in danger, and legit in all caps I was fuuuuuuming about the bringing her back to life. Nah. I\\u2019m fucking sick of it. Death is there for a reason. Get rid of it and you have NO stakes. Which makes all your hard work trying to get the reader to be worried about the character\\u2019s wellbeing null and voidOther things that made me real mad:\\u2022\\u2060 \\u2060what was the point in the viper queen getting a private fight between Sigrid and Ithan????\\u2022\\u2060 \\u2060\\u2060SIGRID. are you fucking kidding me all of that round and round in circles and FOR WHAT.\\u2022\\u2060 \\u2060\\u2060Ithan choosing to try to bring Sigrid back from the dead (reaper form) instead of focusing on what\\u2019s ACTUALLY important aka THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIFE WITH THE BIG BAD?????\\u2022\\u2060 \\u2060\\u2060Bryce opening the coffin. why she acting like a dumb bitch?

They shouldn\\u2019t have ended up back together by the end of this book and we should have gotten him making ALL the amends, her fighting with herself to learn how to trust him again, etc in the next book.

TWIIIIIIIICE? He has literally winnowed just outside the wards and flown inside in a matter of seconds/like, a minute. He does it when Nesta is stuck in that nightmare in ACOSF. and TWICE we get oooooo he\\u2019s coming. look at that encroaching darkness. ooooo you better go. (proceeds to have a long, heartfelt goodbye with mom hugs) *closes portal before he ever arrives* bsffr.When you manage your expectations by being realistic and enjoy tf outta this masterpiece \\ud83d\\ude0c\\ud83e\\udd2dSPOILER FREE REVIEWI honestly feel so emotional finishing this book, saying goodbye to Bryce and Hunt's story. I was thoroughly entertained, invested and satisfied with the way this book was written. I would say that when you go into this book,please keep in mind you're reading Bryce's story, simply put you are going in for Captain Marvel and not Avengers Endgame \\ud83e\\udd37\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0fI also see people disappointed with the way Bryce was in this book.Even though she had few moments where I felt frustrated with her, I fully understood her. In a strange environment, she is not going to or supposed to act calm. She will be paranoid. Meeting new people whom SHE doesn't know and acting suspicious, trying to escape makes ABSOLUTE sense. Even in her irrational actions, there were rational intentions \\ud83d\\udc40Coming back to the book which is divided into Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 like any other Crescent City book.Part 1explored more folklore, history, new places and people (for Bryce) and setting up a much more powerful world building. I found myself loving it, there were some big reveals and connections. I was also shocked to see one of the creatures back in the world and it brought intense memories. It also ends on a brutal note. Iykyk.Part 2was more hands on action, it built on to the reveals made in part 1 brilliantly. I see MANY people saying that this part bored them and dragged on. On the contrary, I found it to be much more intense and mind blowing. Lidia and Ruhn carried it beautifully. Part 2 ends on a very nerve wrecking note, and you'll immediately want to binge the rest of the book.Part 3was simply put- Binge worthy. Big reveals happen here, characters in this world get what they deserve and I ate it up. Ithan and Bryce were my favorite here, and surprisingly Jesiba too. It ends on a satisfying note and I just can't wait to see how it's going to add up to the future books.Onto the characters-\\u2764\\ufe0f\\u200d\\ud83d\\udd25Bryce-Although a bit erratic her actions are completely justified imo. She is the same Bryce we have grown to love- smartass, funny, badass, always standing up for the right and calculating. The sacrifices she's willing to make was emotional to see. But like any other, she does have flaws and is imperfect.\\u26a1Hunt-My man. The way he cared for Bryce was everything. Even while getting tortured to the point where he is close to death, all he cared about was Bryce and his friends. He would do anything to protect them, even if it means he's gonna end up hurt. His big reveal was one that I was never expecting and I was shook. I loved seeing him unleash and put Celestina in her place.\\ud83d\\udd25Lidia-I LOVE her. She did so much for literally everyone good in this book, such huge sacrifices. She did not put herself first once and I loved her. I swear I just want to give her the biggest hug.\\ud83d\\udda4Ruhn-Loved seeing the way he felt for Lidia. Man's had me gasping, crying, emotional for more. His bond with Hunt and Baxian was intense and so loyal. The way he was protecting Bryce was everything. Tho that one scene made me dizzy (you know which one).\\ud83d\\udc3aIthan and \\ud83e\\udddc\\u200d\\u2642\\ufe0fTharion-Although different paths, I found them to be quite similar with the way they deal with their struggles. Before anyone gets frustrated with these two- Have you ever made a mistake and in order to correct it desperately, you make more bad decisions and more mistakes?? That sounds pretty relatable to me. Not all of us are perfect. Living in self loathing, guilt, and anxiety isn't easy. Tharion and Ithan thinking that they don't deserve anything good happening to them after making so many mistakes is real and it's amental health representation at its best.So many people acting like Tharion and Ithan were annoying breaks my heart cause I found them to be so endearing and loving, so loyal, so worthy despite what the two thought. I just wish to hold them and talk to them about it all.Baxian-All I'll say is he has strong teeth \\ud83d\\ude2dJesiba and Hypaxia-I appreciated so much what these two did, especially Jesiba. Without giving too much away, am sure you'll like them more.The romances-Bryce and Hunt-Honestly, after Feyre and Rhys these two are my favorite SJM couple and they are immensely underrated. Even in their arguments, they know when to support each other. They're the couple who will support each other in public even if they are wrong and correct the other in private.Ruhn and Lidia-So angsty. It's like they broke my heart multiple times and mended it to complete perfection. Literally everything about them is PERFECT. I loved how they communicated and bared themselves to each other.Also, did SJM throw in the marriage of convenience trope? \\ud83d\\udc40Y'all gotta find out for which couple, no spoilers here. \\ud83e\\udd2d\\ud83e\\udd2dI believe people have forgotten that this is Bryce's story. In order to enjoy this book, you gotta keep that in mind. I can already see that SJM has foreshadowed a lot of multiversal possible scenarios. Hopefully she'll explore them on an Endgame level someday.But for now, am excited to see where the Crescent City series will go from here \\ud83d\\ude09 I highly recommend reading this series after ToG and ESPECIALLY ACOTAR.I did not want this to end, I could still read another 500 pages of this beautiful book and world. Already can't wait to reread \\ud83d\\ude2d\\u2764\\u2022~\\u2022~IT'S FINALLY HERE \\ud83d\\ude0d\\ud83d\\ude0d In all it's glory \\ud83e\\udd79\\ud83e\\udd79~\\u2022~\\u2022~Am so ready for Jan 2024The weakest conclusion to an SJM series by far. This book was one big deus ex machina clusterfuck. But I think most fans will overlook the huge issues in this book because we get to see some old favourite characters.Let's start off with the good parts:- Lidia Cervos \\ud83e\\uddce\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f\\ud83e\\uddce\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0f\\ud83e\\uddce\\ud83c\\udffb\\u200d\\u2640\\ufe0fFew characters had any agency in this book. Lidia was one of the few people who actually made a difference in this book. She really stole the show from Bryce and Hunt.- In the same vein as Lidia, Nesta lit up every scene she was in. Every scene she was in, I only noticed her. She really carried every part of the story she touched and she is so fun.- And obviously the entire Prythian part because those characters are elite. Loved the lore drop we got.- There was a particular scene with a few characters waving at each other that broke my heart.Now on to the bad:- Welcome to the Bryce Quinlan Show, where I spent 50% of the book asking myself \\\"Why are Tharion/Flynn/Declan/Sathia/Hunt/Ruhn even in this scene??\\\". So much of this book involved Bryce and Co. going somewhere to do something. But they all could have been Bryce's solo missions because it literally would not have made a difference if her companions weren't there. I think this was made particularly evident because there were 3 or 4 times where Bryce had to relay stuff she had done in the previous chapters to her group of friends. Because her friends weren't doing anything. The side characters felt soooo unnecessary in so many points in this book.- Another note on Bryce, she has some smart moments in the book but so much of her dominance is because she is The Chosen One. Everything she gains is because she is related to XYZ and has ABC in her blood. It makes it really hard to root for her because she didn't have to earn anything.- As I already mentioned in HOSAB, Bryce is only interesting in the context of Danika. By herself, she isn't that particularly interesting or someone I would root for. I think the strongest part about her was her friendship to Danika. This is particularly evident when anything happens between Hunt and Bryce. They just don't have that much chemistry tbh. I really wish this series had been about Bryce and Danika. Hunt really felt like a side piece. I really dgaf about this man.- I can't believe I had to read about Hunt going commando because his d**k is too big to fit into his underwear. I actually wanted to gouge my eyes out. \\ud83e\\udd22\\ud83d\\ude35\\u200d\\ud83d\\udcab\\ud83d\\ude35 Also Hunt and Bryce getting handsy while their friends were fighting for their lives? Why were Ruhn and Lidia trying to get it on while their friends were literally right beside them in the cave? The most unnecessary scenes that were added just so this book can be spicy.- Ithan LOLOLOL. If you look up \\\"filler character\\\" he would be the #1 offender. He actually didn't do anything in this book for the first 70% and then he suddenly just have everything happen to him. His rise in power was the most eye-rolling experience because he doesn't deserve any of this.- Tharion sorry babes I wish I had skipped every scene you were in. I actually do not give a fck about this man. Suddenly Sathia appears. What did she even add to the story? Tharion and Ithan were the two most ridiculous characters in this book. I'm actually so mad both of them got so much \\\"screen time\\\". But Tharion might get the \\\"Nesta\\\" treatment because it is clear his story isn't over.- In true SJM fashion, we get the \\\"We could have told you all of this in Book 1 but you weren't ready so we are just going to explain everything now\\\". I'm so sick and tired of important information being gatekept for the sake of having a plot.- I want SO MUCH MORE grovelling between Ruhn and Lidia. I wanted the angst and yearning and the hurt x comfort. They are by far the best couple in this series.- LOOOL COOPER. Why did we focus so much on Sophie and Emilie in book 2 for them to basically not matter at all.- Sigrid and Ariadne felt like loose ends. Perhaps they will be important in future books but they took up too much time in this book for them to not matter much at the end.- OK, so book 1 had that big dramatic massacre, which really got my hopes up that SJM would actually commit to some gruesome ends for some of her main characters. SYKE! I'm so tired of none of the characters actually being in danger.- Hypaxia exists to be a deus ex machina. Her and Jesiba's sole purpose in the series is to get people out of a pickle. They literally didn't serve any other purpose.- Also where were Juniper and Fury? They were completely neglected except for one scene.- While writing this, I just remembered I haven't even mentioned Baxian. That just shows how insignificant he was in every scene he was in. He just gets lumped in with Hunt and Co.- The Harpy comes back for her to get KO'd in 0.2 seconds?- Hypaxia defeats a certain character very quickly. It felt so out of left field and rushed.Overall, this book felt sloppy.\",\n          \"As the first book in the series,Key of Lightdid the job: it set the story arc up, introduced all the main characters and, in the end, wrapped up the first couple's love story in a nice HEA.The PNR aspect of the story was interesting, with a gothic vibe that was eerie and unexpected. An old mansion namedWarrior's Peak, guarded by gargoyles, sitting at the top of a hill surrounded by mist... A dark and stormy night... A woman drivingalone, wondering what she was going to find at the mansion... That was on the first pages of the book and, no matter howclich\\u00e9that was, I was chilled to the bone and wondering if Malory, the heroine, would turn out to be one of those TSTL blondes whose aim in life is to step willingly into the arms of death just to keep the story going. Thankfully, it wasn't like that and the story moved along quite nicely, once Malory and her newfound friends/partners Dana and Zoe, the heroines in the following books in the series, were presented with thetaskthey were supposed to do: find the keys that would release the souls of three demigoddesses who had been imprisoned hundreds of years ago. I'm not going into details here, but the tale about their lives was very charming and romantic - regardless of the sad ending, that is.Flynn, Dana's brother, joined the quest for the keys in no time, even though he was skeptical about the whole thing... Well, all of them were skeptical at first, but they changed their minds when strange things started to happen. Back to Flynn... He was the all-around good guy, charming, seductive and, of course, commitment-shy. Malory was soon in love with him - who could blame her? :) - and he was in too, even though it took him longer to see it that way. There was really no conflict in their relationship, and that was a problem for me. Not that I wanted them to go all angsty or start a fight just for the sake of it, but there wasn't anything that prevented them from being together and their relationship felt kind of boring to me.On the other hand, I think NR did a much better job when it came to showing Flynn's friendship with Jordan and Brad - not coincidentally, the heroes in the next books in the series. I actually thought that Flynn's scenes with his friends were more interesting than his scenes with Malory, and that's not a good thing in Romancelandia. Malory's scenes with Dana and Zoe were less entertaining and felt a little too juvenile to me. They would have been more fitting if they had been in their early twenties, IMHO.There's a lot of talk about symbolism and coincidences in this book: some interesting, some confusing. I thought the \\\"key\\\" Malory was supposed to find was only a metaphor but it turned out to be \\\"real\\\" - or the next best thing, since this is a PNR story. As for the ending, I was as fooled by Malory's trick as the villain: I thought Flynn would have to rescue her with a bang, but I should have known that she was smart enough to do it by herself. Girl Power, yay! ;)All things considered, this was an overall good, although not stellar, read for a nice and lazy afternoon/evening. And, referring to the first paragraph above, it did the job: I'm interested enough in keep reading the series.DEAR Ms. Roberts,I totally believe that two people who havespent a whole summer jumping out of planes and escaping DEATH BY FIREtogether on a daily basis might fall in love and get married after knowing each other for only a few months.It also seems plausible that you might fall in love witha guy who had a crush on you in high school, or even possiblyyour car mechanic, but deciding to marry this random dude with an annoying dog three weeks after you met him, just because you went on some wackadoo fairy quest with him and had sex on an ugly couch?Unplausible.Also, stuff like, \\\"I can walk three miles in these heels. I'm a professional female\\\"? VOM.No love,JenneNora Robertssure knows how to write a good romance, especially a mystical one which includes gods and goddesses and a quest to find three ancient keys.Key of Lightis the first book in the trilogy and it introduces us to Malory, Dana and Zoe, the three young women who are set to try and find the three keys. Malory has the first challenge and she works her way to success with the help of her two friends and new boyfriend Flynn.In true Roberts style the characters are delightful, there are plenty of very funny lines and there is a gorgeous dog making his presence known throughout. Plenty of magic, a spooky mansion and scary storms. I loved it.I'd like to start by thanking my lovely friendCelestefor making me discover one of her favorite authors and feel-good series! <3And Key of Light totally made me feel insanely good! I enjoyed it, a lot, and if I've had more free time, I'd have read it in one sitting (I felt the same during my 2nd read. Even though I knew where the story was headed, I couldn't wait to reach its climax). The writing flowed easily and told the story of Malory, Dana and Zoe, 3 passionate, dedicated women, thrown into a strange and almost impossible quest.My favorite aspect of the book was the dynamics between the female characters. We absolutely need more of that positivity, benevolence and unconditional support, in fiction but most importantly in real life relationships. It was everything I'd love to have and see in a friendship: no wanton judgement or pettiness, no envy or unnecessary drama.#Friendshipgoals y'all!I know that must sound like a Utopian and naive fantasy on my part, but this comfort was exactly what I have been looking for and expecting from this series:an uncomplicated, a tad predictable, not entirely without clich\\u00e9s(especially when it comes to women's perception of men, and vice versa),but most importantly light and sweet read.As my friend Celeste says about Nora's books, in herCome Sundown review:\\\"Yes, her work is formulaic, but it\\u2019s supposed to be!! I don\\u2019t pick up her books to be surprised; I pick them up for their familiarity and the comfort that brings.\\\"Besides the touching relationships, art was a central and most beautifully described theme in this book. Nora Roberts made an excellent job at defining it and conveying the emotions it induces in both the artist and the audience. I felt a huge kinship for Malory because of her inability to create art (despiteherknowledge and boundless love of it) and because of her career crisis. Man! Both struck a chord!Anything worth anything can be found in books.Overall, Key of Light was a very easy and enjoyable read! Despite the romantic aspect being too abrupt, some parts of the quest being convenient and despite the POVs switching non stop everyfew paragraps, my interest and excitement never faltered. The chemistry between the three women made me root for them and the crises they've been facing in their personal lives made them more real and extremely relatable. I can't wait to dive into the sequel and having more of bookish and sarcastic Dana's story.alot happened and not alot happened, it strange.but i like it enough too read the next one.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster,  Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin's Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love.
